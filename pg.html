A lot of people seemed surprised that someone interested in computers would also be interested in painting. They seemed to think that hacking and painting were very different kinds of work-- that hacking was cold, precise, and methodical, and that painting was the frenzied expression of some primal urge.<br><br>Both of these images are wrong.  Hacking and painting have a lot in common.  In fact, of all the different types of people I've known, hackers and painters are among the most alike.<br><br>What hackers and painters have in common is that they're both makers.  Along with composers, architects, and writers, what hackers and painters are trying to do is make good things. They're not doing research per se, though if in the course of trying to make good things they discover some new technique, so much the better.<br><br><br><br>I've never liked the term "computer science."  The main reason I don't like it is that there's no such thing. Computer science is a grab bag of tenuously related areas thrown together by an accident of history, like Yugoslavia. At one end you have people who are really mathematicians, but call what they're doing computer science so they can get DARPA grants. In the middle you have people working on something like the natural history of computers-- studying the behavior of algorithms for routing data through networks, for example.  And then at the other extreme you have the hackers, who are trying to write interesting software, and for whom computers are just a medium of expression, as concrete is for architects or paint for painters.  It's as if mathematicians, physicists, and architects all had to be in the same department.<br><br>Sometimes what the hackers do is called "software engineering," but this term is just as misleading. Good software designers are no more engineers than architects are. The border between architecture and engineering is not sharply defined, but it's there. It falls between what and how: architects decide what to do, and engineers figure out how to do it.<br><br>What and how should not be kept too separate.  You're asking for trouble if you try to decide what to do without understanding how to do it. But hacking can certainly be more than just deciding how to implement some spec.  At its best, it's creating the spec-- though it turns out the best way to do that is to implement it.<br><br><br><br>Perhaps one day "computer science" will, like Yugoslavia, get broken up into its component parts.  That might be a good thing.  Especially if it meant independence for my native land, hacking.<br><br>Bundling all these different types of work together in one department may be convenient administratively, but it's confusing intellectually. That's the other reason I don't like the name "computer science."  Arguably the people in the middle are doing something like an experimental science.  But the people at either end, the hackers and the mathematicians, are not actually doing science.<br><br>The mathematicians don't seem bothered by this.  They happily set to work proving theorems like the other mathematicians over in the math department, and probably soon stop noticing that the building they work in says ``computer science'' on the outside.  But for the hackers this label is a problem. If what they're doing is called science, it makes them feel they ought to be acting scientific. So instead of doing what they really want to do, which is    to design beautiful software, hackers in universities and research labs feel they ought to be writing research papers.<br><br>In the best case, the papers are just a formality.  Hackers write cool software, and then write a paper about it, and the paper becomes a proxy for the achievement represented by the software. But often this mismatch causes problems.  It's easy to drift away from building beautiful things toward building ugly things that make more suitable subjects for research papers.<br><br>Unfortunately, beautiful things don't always make the best subjects for papers. Number one, research must be original-- and as anyone who has written a PhD dissertation knows, the way to be sure that you're exploring virgin territory is to to stake out a piece of ground that no one wants.  Number two, research must be substantial-- and awkward systems yield meatier papers, because you can write about the obstacles you have to overcome in order to get things done.  Nothing yields meaty problems like starting with the wrong assumptions.  Most of AI is an example of this rule; if you assume that knowledge can be represented as a list of predicate logic expressions whose arguments represent abstract concepts, you'll have a lot of papers to write about how to make this work.  As Ricky Ricardo used to say, "Lucy, you got a lot of explaining to do."<br><br>The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle tweaks to something that already exists, or to combine existing ideas in a slightly new way.  This kind of work is hard to convey in a research paper.<br><br><br><br>So why do universities and research labs continue to judge hackers by publications? For the same reason that "scholastic aptitude" gets measured by simple-minded standardized tests, or the productivity of programmers gets measured in lines of code. These tests are easy to apply, and there is nothing so tempting as an easy test that kind of works.<br><br>Measuring what hackers are actually trying to do, designing beautiful software, would be much more difficult.  You need a good <a href="taste.html">sense of design</a> to judge  good design.  And there is no correlation, except possibly a <a href="http://www.apa.org/journals/features/psp7761121.pdf">negative</a>  one, between people's ability to recognize good design and their confidence that they can.<br><br>The only external test is time.  Over time, beautiful things tend to thrive, and ugly things tend to get discarded.  Unfortunately, the amounts of time involved can be longer than human lifetimes.  Samuel Johnson said it took a hundred years for a writer's reputation to converge.  You have to wait for the writer's influential friends to die, and then for all their followers to die.<br><br>I think hackers just have to resign themselves to having a large random component in their reputations.  In this they are no different from other makers.  In fact, they're lucky by comparison.    The influence of fashion is not nearly so great in hacking as it is in painting.<br><br><br><br>There are worse things than having people misunderstand your work.  A worse danger is that you will yourself misunderstand your work.  Related fields are where you go looking for ideas.  If you find yourself in the computer science department, there is a natural temptation to believe, for example, that hacking is the applied version of what theoretical computer science is the theory of.   All the time I was in graduate school I had an uncomfortable feeling in the back of my mind that I ought to know more theory, and that it was very remiss of me to have forgotten all that stuff within three weeks of the final exam.<br><br>Now I realize I was mistaken.  Hackers need to understand the theory of computation about as much as painters need to understand paint chemistry. You need to know how to calculate time and space complexity and about Turing completeness.  You might also want to remember at least the concept of a state machine, in case you have to write a parser or a regular expression library.  Painters in fact    have to remember a good deal more about paint chemistry than  that.<br><br>I've found that the best sources of ideas are not the other fields that have the word "computer" in their names, but the other fields inhabited by makers. Painting has been a much richer source of ideas than the theory of computation.<br><br>For example, I was taught in college that one ought to figure out a program completely on paper before even going near a computer.  I found that I did not program this way.  I found that I liked to program sitting in front of a computer, not a piece of paper.  Worse still, instead of patiently writing out a complete program and assuring myself it was correct, I tended to just spew out code that was hopelessly broken, and gradually beat it into shape.  Debugging, I was taught, was a kind of final pass where you caught typos and oversights.  The way I worked, it seemed like programming consisted of debugging.<br><br>For a long time I felt bad about this, just as I once felt bad that I didn't hold my pencil the way they taught me to in elementary school. If I had only looked over at the other makers, the painters or the architects, I would have realized that there was a name for what I was doing: sketching.  As far as I can tell, the way they taught me to program in college was all wrong. You should figure out programs as you're writing them, just as writers and painters and architects do.<br><br>Realizing this has real implications for software design. It means that a programming language should, above all, be malleable.  A programming language is for  <a href="piraha.html">thinking</a> of programs, not for expressing programs you've already thought of.  It should be a pencil, not a pen.  Static typing would be a fine idea if people actually did write programs the way they taught me to in college.  But that's not how any of the   hackers I know write programs.  We need a language that lets us scribble and smudge and smear, not a language where you have to sit with a teacup of types balanced on your knee and make polite conversation with a strict old aunt of a compiler.<br><br><br><br>While we're on the subject of static typing, identifying with the makers will save us from another problem that afflicts the sciences: math envy.  Everyone in the sciences secretly believes that mathematicians are smarter than they are.   I think mathematicians also believe this.  At any rate, the result is that scientists tend to make their work look as mathematical as possible.  In a field like physics this probably doesn't do much harm, but the further you get from the natural sciences, the more of a problem it becomes.<br><br>A page of formulas just looks so impressive. (Tip: for extra impressiveness, use Greek variables.)  And so there is a great temptation to work on problems you can treat formally, rather than problems that are, say, important.<br><br>If hackers identified with other makers, like writers and painters, they wouldn't feel tempted to do       this.  Writers and painters don't suffer from math envy. They feel as if they're doing something completely unrelated. So are hackers, I think.<br><br><br><br>If universities and research labs keep hackers from doing the kind of work they want to do, perhaps the place for them is in companies. Unfortunately, most companies won't let hackers do what they want either.  Universities and research labs force hackers to be scientists, and companies force them to be engineers.<br><br>I only discovered this myself quite recently.  When Yahoo bought Viaweb, they asked me what I wanted to do.  I had never liked the business side very much, and said that I just wanted to hack.  When I got to Yahoo, I found that what hacking meant to them was implementing software, not designing it.  Programmers were seen as technicians who translated the visions (if that is the word) of product managers into code.<br><br>This seems to be the default plan in big companies.  They do it because it decreases the standard deviation of the outcome. Only a small percentage of hackers can actually design software, and it's hard for the people running a company to pick these out.  So instead of entrusting the future of the software to one brilliant hacker, most companies set things up so that it is designed by committee, and the hackers merely implement the design.<br><br>If you want to make money at some point, remember this, because this is one of the reasons startups win.  Big companies want to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because they want to avoid disasters.  But when you damp oscillations, you lose the high points as well as the low.  This is not a problem for big companies, because they don't win by making great products.  Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.<br><br>So if you can figure out a way to get in a design war with a company big enough that its software is    designed by product managers, they'll never be able to keep up with you.  These opportunities are not easy to find, though. It's hard to engage a big company in a design war, just as it's hard to engage an opponent inside a castle in hand to hand combat.  It would be pretty easy to write a better word processor than Microsoft Word, for example, but Microsoft, within the castle of their operating system monopoly, probably wouldn't even notice if you did.<br><br>The place to fight design wars is in new markets, where no one has yet managed to establish any fortifications.  That's where you can win big by taking the bold approach to design, and having the same people both design and implement the product.   Microsoft themselves did this at the start.  So did Apple. And Hewlett-Packard.  I suspect almost every successful startup has.<br><br><br><br>So one way to build great software is to start your own startup.  There are two problems with this, though.  One is that in a startup you have to do so much besides write software. At Viaweb I considered myself lucky if I got to hack a quarter of the time.  And the things I had to    do the other three quarters of the time ranged from tedious to terrifying.  I have a benchmark for this, because I once had to leave a board meeting to have some cavities filled.  I remember sitting back in the dentist's chair, waiting for the drill, and feeling like I was on vacation.<br><br>The other problem with startups is that there is not much overlap between the kind of software that makes money and the kind that's interesting to write.  Programming languages are interesting to write, and Microsoft's first product was one, in fact, but no one will pay for programming languages now.  If you want to make money, you tend to be forced to work on problems that are too nasty for anyone to solve for free.<br><br>All makers face this problem.  Prices are determined by supply and demand, and there is just not as much demand for things that are fun to work on as there is for things that solve the mundane problems of individual customers. Acting in off-Broadway plays just doesn't pay as well as wearing a gorilla suit in someone's booth at a trade show.  Writing novels doesn't pay as well as writing ad copy for garbage disposals. And hacking programming languages doesn't pay as well as figuring out how to connect some company's legacy database to their Web server.<br><br><br><br>I think the answer to this problem, in the case of software, is a concept known to nearly all makers: the day job. This phrase began with musicians, who perform at night.  More generally, it means that you have one kind of work you do for money, and another for love.<br><br>Nearly all makers have day jobs early in their careers. Painters and writers notoriously do.  If you're lucky you can get a day job that's closely related to your real work.  Musicians often seem to work in record stores.  A hacker working on some programming language or operating system might likewise be able to get a day job using it.  [1]<br><br>When I say that the answer is for hackers to have day jobs,  and work on beautiful software on the side, I'm not proposing this as a new idea.  This is what open-source hacking is all    about.  What I'm saying is that open-source is probably the right model, because it has been independently confirmed by all the   other makers.<br><br>It seems surprising to me that any employer would be reluctant to let hackers work on open-source projects. At Viaweb, we would have been reluctant to hire anyone who didn't.  When we interviewed programmers, the main thing we cared about was what kind of software they wrote in their spare time. You can't do anything really well unless you love it, and if you love to hack you'll inevitably be working on projects of your own. [2]<br><br><br><br>Because hackers are makers rather than scientists, the right place to look for metaphors is not in the sciences, but among other kinds of makers.  What else can painting teach us about hacking?<br><br>One thing we can learn, or at least confirm, from the example of painting is how to learn to hack.  You learn to paint mostly by doing it. Ditto for hacking.  Most hackers don't learn to hack by taking college courses in programming.  They learn to hack by writing programs of their own at age thirteen.  Even in    college classes, you learn to hack mostly by hacking. [3]<br><br>Because painters leave a trail of work behind them, you can watch them learn by doing.  If you look at the work of a painter in chronological order, you'll find that each   painting builds on things that have been learned in previous ones.  When there's something in a painting that works very well, you can usually find version  1 of it in a smaller form in some earlier painting.<br><br>I think most makers work this way.  Writers and architects seem to as well.  Maybe it would be good for hackers to act more like painters, and regularly start over from scratch, instead of continuing to work for years on one project, and trying to incorporate all their later ideas as revisions.<br><br>The fact that hackers learn to hack by doing it is another sign of how different hacking is from the sciences.  Scientists don't learn science by doing it, but by doing labs and problem sets. Scientists start out doing work that's perfect, in the sense that they're just trying to reproduce work someone else has  already done for them. Eventually, they get to the point where they can do original work. Whereas hackers, from the start, are doing original work; it's just very bad.  So hackers start original, and get good, and scientists start good, and get original.<br><br><br><br> The other way makers learn is from examples. For a painter, a museum is a reference library of techniques. For hundreds of years it has been part of the traditional education of painters to copy the works of the great masters, because copying forces you to look closely at the way a painting is made.<br><br>Writers do this too. Benjamin Franklin learned to write by summarizing the points    in the essays of Addison and Steele and then trying to reproduce them.  Raymond Chandler did the same thing with detective stories.<br><br>Hackers, likewise, can learn to program by looking at  good programs-- not just at what they do, but the source code too.  One of the less publicized benefits of the open-source movement is that it has made it easier to learn to program.  When I learned to program, we had to rely mostly on examples in books.  The one big chunk of code available then was Unix, but even this was not    open source.  Most of the people who read the source read it in illicit photocopies of John Lions' book, which though written in 1977 was not allowed to be published until 1996.<br><br><br><br>Another example we can take from painting is the way that paintings are created by gradual refinement.  Paintings usually begin with a sketch. Gradually the details get filled in. But it is not merely a process of filling in. Sometimes    the original plans turn out to be mistaken. Countless paintings, when you look at them in xrays, turn out to have limbs that have been moved or facial features that have been readjusted.<br><br>Here's a case where we can learn from painting.  I think hacking should work this way too.  It's unrealistic to expect that the specifications for a program will be perfect. You're better off if you admit this up front, and write programs in a way that allows specifications to change on the fly.<br><br>(The structure of large companies makes this hard for them to do, so here is another place where startups have an advantage.)<br><br>Everyone by now presumably knows about the danger of premature optimization.  I think we should be just as worried about premature design-- deciding too early what a program should do.<br><br>The right tools can help us avoid this danger. A good programming language should, like oil paint, make it easy to change your mind.  Dynamic typing is a win here because you don't have to commit to specific data representations up front. But the key to flexibility, I think, is to make the language very <a href="power.html">abstract</a>. The easiest program to change is one that's very short.<br><br><br><br> This sounds like a paradox, but a great painting has to be better than it has to be. For example, when Leonardo painted the portrait of <a href="ginevra.html">Ginevra de Benci</a> in the National Gallery, he put a juniper bush behind her head. In it he carefully painted each individual leaf.  Many painters might have thought, this is just something to put in the background to frame her head.  No one will look that closely at it.<br><br>Not Leonardo.  How hard he worked on part of a painting didn't depend at all on how closely he expected anyone to look at it. He was like Michael Jordan.  Relentless.<br><br>Relentlessness wins because, in the aggregate, unseen details become visible. When people walk by the portrait of Ginevra de Benci, their attention is often immediately arrested by it, even before they look at the label and notice that it says Leonardo da Vinci.  All those unseen details combine to produce something that's just stunning, like a thousand barely audible voices all singing in tune.<br><br>Great software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to beauty.  If you look inside good software, you find that parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too. I'm not claiming I write great software, but I know that when it comes to code I behave in a way that would make me eligible for prescription drugs if I approached everyday life the same way. It drives me crazy to see code that's badly indented, or that uses ugly variable names.<br><br><br><br>If a hacker were a mere implementor, turning a spec into code, then he could just work his way through it from one end to the other like someone digging a ditch.  But if the hacker is a creator, we have to take inspiration into account.<br><br>In hacking, like painting, work comes in cycles.  Sometimes you get excited about some new project and you want to work sixteen hours a day on it.  Other times nothing seems interesting.<br><br>To do good work you have to take these cycles into account, because they're affected by how you react to them. When you're driving a car with a manual transmission on a hill, you have to back off the clutch sometimes to avoid stalling.  Backing off can likewise prevent ambition from stalling. In both painting and hacking there are some tasks that are terrifyingly ambitious, and others that are comfortingly routine.  It's a good idea to save some easy tasks for moments when you would otherwise stall.<br><br>In hacking, this can literally mean saving up bugs. I like debugging: it's the one time that hacking is as straightforward as    people think it is.  You have a totally constrained problem, and all you have to do is solve it.  Your program is supposed to do x.  Instead it does y. Where does it go wrong? You know you're going to win in the end.  It's as relaxing as painting a wall.<br><br><br><br>The example of painting can teach us not only how to manage our own work, but how to work together.  A lot of the great art of the past is the work of multiple hands, though there may only be one name on the wall next to it in the museum.  Leonardo was an apprentice in the workshop of Verrocchio and painted one of the angels in his <a href="baptism.html">Baptism of Christ</a>.  This sort of thing was the rule, not the exception. Michelangelo was considered especially dedicated for insisting on painting all the figures on the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel himself.<br><br>As far as I know, when painters worked together on a painting, they never worked on the same parts.  It was common for the master to paint the principal figures and for assistants to paint the others and the background.  But you never had one guy painting over the work of another.<br><br>I think this is the right model for collaboration in software too.  Don't push it too far.  When a piece of code is being hacked by three or four different people, no one of whom really owns it, it will end up being like a common-room.  It will tend to feel bleak and abandoned, and accumulate cruft. The right way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply defined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces between them that are as carefully designed and, if possible, as articulated as programming languages.<br><br><br><br>Like painting, most software is intended for a human audience.  And so hackers, like painters, must have empathy to do really great work.  You have to be able to see things from the user's point of view.<br><br>When I was a kid I was always being told to look at things from someone else's point of view.  What this always meant in practice was to do what someone else wanted, instead of what I wanted.  This of course gave empathy a bad name, and I made a point of not cultivating it.<br><br>Boy, was I wrong.  It turns out that looking at things from  other people's point of view is practically the secret of success.  It doesn't necessarily mean being self-sacrificing. Far from it.  Understanding how someone else sees things doesn't imply that you'll act in his interest; in some situations-- in war, for example-- you want to do exactly the opposite. [4]<br><br>Most makers make things for a human audience. And to engage an audience you have to understand what they need. Nearly all the greatest paintings are paintings of people, for example, because people are what people are interested in.<br><br>Empathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker and a great one.  Some hackers are quite smart, but when it comes to empathy are practically solipsists.  It's hard for such       people to design great software [5], because they can't see things from the user's point of view.<br><br>One way to tell how good people are at empathy is to watch them explain a technical question to someone without a technical background.  We probably all know people who, though otherwise smart, are just comically bad at this.  If someone asks them at a dinner party what a programming language is, they'll say something like ``Oh, a high-level language is what the compiler uses as input to generate object code.'' High-level language?  Compiler?  Object code?  Someone who  doesn't know what a programming language is obviously doesn't know what these things are, either.<br><br>Part of what software has to do is explain itself.  So to    write good software you have to understand how little users    understand. They're going to walk up to the software with no preparation, and it had better do what they guess it will, because they're not going to read the manual.  The best system I've ever seen  in this respect was the original Macintosh, in 1985. It did what software almost never does: it just worked. [6]<br><br>Source code, too, should explain itself.  If I could get people to remember just one quote about programming, it would be the one at the beginning of <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs.</i>   <blockquote> Programs should be written for people to read, and only incidentally for machines to execute. </blockquote> You need to have  empathy not just for your users, but for your readers.  It's in   your interest, because you'll be one of them. Many a hacker has written a program only to find on returning to it six months later that he has no idea    how it works.  I know several people who've sworn off Perl after such experiences. [7]<br><br>Lack of empathy is associated with intelligence, to the point that there is even something of a fashion for it in some places. But I don't think there's any correlation. You can do well in math and the natural sciences without having to learn empathy, and people in these fields tend to be smart, so the two qualities have come to be associated.  But there are plenty of dumb people who are bad at empathy too.  Just listen to the people who call in with questions on talk shows.  They ask whatever it is they're asking in such a roundabout way that the hosts often have to rephrase the question for them.<br><br><br><br>So, if hacking works like painting and writing, is it as cool? After all, you only get one life. You might as well spend it working on something great.<br><br>Unfortunately, the question is hard to answer.  There is always a big time lag in prestige.  It's like light from a distant star. Painting has prestige now because of great work people did five hundred years ago.  At the time, no one thought these paintings were as important as we do today.  It would have seemed very odd to people at the time that Federico da Montefeltro, the Duke of Urbino, would one day be known mostly as the guy with the strange nose in a <a href="montefeltro.html">painting</a>  by Piero della Francesca.<br><br>So while I admit that hacking doesn't seem as cool as painting now, we should remember that painting itself didn't seem as cool in its glory days as it does now.<br><br>What we can say with some confidence is that these are the glory days of hacking.  In most fields the great work is done early on. The paintings made between 1430 and 1500 are still unsurpassed. Shakespeare appeared just as professional theater was being born, <!-- plays were emerging from crude farces put on in the courtyards of coaching inns, --> and pushed the medium so far that every playwright since has had to live in his shadow. Albrecht Durer did the same thing with engraving, and Jane Austen with the novel.<br><br>Over and over we see the same pattern.  A new medium appears, and people are so excited about it that they explore most of its possibilities in the first couple generations.   Hacking seems to be in this phase now.<br><br>Painting was not, in Leonardo's time, as cool as his work helped make it. How cool hacking turns out to be will depend on what we can do with this new medium.   <!--In some ways, the time lag of coolness is an advantage.  When you meet someone now who is writing a compiler or hacking a Unix kernel, at least you know they're not just doing it to pick up chicks.--><br><br><br><br><br> <b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] The greatest damage that photography has done to painting may be the fact that it killed the best day job. Most of the great painters in history supported themselves by painting portraits.  <!-- Until about 1870, there was always a cadre of painters trained in the most difficult task in art, painting the human face from life.  --><br><br>[2] I've been told that Microsoft discourages employees from contributing to open-source projects, even in their spare time. But so many of the best hackers work on open-source projects now that the main effect of this policy may be to ensure that they won't be able to hire any first-rate programmers.<br><br>[3] What you learn about programming in college is much like what you learn about books or clothes or dating: what bad taste you had in high school.<br><br>[4] Here's an example of applied empathy. At Viaweb, if we couldn't decide between two alternatives, we'd ask, what would our competitors hate most?  At one point a competitor added a feature to their software that was basically useless, but since it was one of few they had that we didn't, they made much of it in the trade press. We could have tried to explain that the feature was useless, but we decided it would annoy our competitor more if we just implemented it ourselves, so we hacked together our own version that afternoon.<br><br>[5] Except text editors and compilers.  Hackers don't need empathy to design these, because they are themselves typical users.<br><br>[6] Well, almost.  They overshot the available RAM somewhat, causing much inconvenient disk swapping, but this could be fixed within a few months by buying an additional disk drive.<br><br>[7] The way to make programs easy to read is not to stuff them with comments. I would take Abelson and Sussman's quote a step further.  Programming languages should be designed to express algorithms, and only incidentally to tell computers how to execute them.  A good programming language ought to be better for explaining software than English. You should only need comments when there is some kind of kludge you need to warn readers about, just as on a road there are only arrows on parts with unexpectedly sharp curves. <!-- [8] Leonardo was paid the same amount for painting the Virgin of the Rocks as the workshop that made the frame for it. --><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Robert Morris, Dan Giffin, and Lisa Randall for reading drafts of this, and to Henry Leitner and Larry Finkelstein for inviting me to speak.<br><br></font>

I think your best bet would be to start or join a startup.  That's been a  reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years.  The word "startup"  dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is  very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the Middle Ages.<br><br>Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase "high-tech startup" is almost redundant.  A startup is a small company that takes on a hard technical problem.<br><br>Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than that. You don't have to know physics to be a good pitcher.  But I think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles. Why do startups have to be small?   Will a startup inevitably stop being a startup as it grows larger?   And why do they so often work on developing new technology?   Why are there so many startups selling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oil or laundry detergent?<br><br><b>The Proposition</b><br><br>Economically, you can think of a startup as a way to  compress your whole working life into a few years.  Instead of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as hard as you possibly can for four.  This pays especially well in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.<br><br>Here is a brief sketch of the economic proposition.  If you're a good hacker in your mid twenties, you can get a job paying about $80,000 per year.  So on average  such a hacker must be able to do at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the  company just to break even.  You could probably work twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if you focus you can probably get three times as much done in an hour.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font> You should get another multiple of two, at least, by eliminating the drag  of the pointy-haired middle manager who would be your boss in a big company. Then there is one more multiple: how much smarter are you than your job description expects you to be? Suppose another multiple of three.  Combine all these multipliers, and I'm claiming you could be 36 times more  productive than you're expected to be in a random corporate job.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>   If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a  big company, then a smart hacker working very hard without any corporate bullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about $3 million a year.<br><br>Like all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this one has a lot of wiggle room.  I wouldn't try to defend the actual numbers.  But I stand by the  structure of the calculation.  I'm not claiming the multiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly more than 10, and probably rarely as high as 100.<br><br>If $3 million a year seems high, remember that we're talking about the limit case: the case where you not only have zero leisure time but indeed work so hard that you endanger your health.<br><br>Startups are not magic.  They don't change the laws of wealth creation.  They just represent a point at the far end of the curve. There is a conservation law at work here: if you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a  million dollars' worth of pain.   For example, one way to make a million dollars would be to work for the  Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your  salary.  Imagine the stress of working for the Post  Office for fifty years.   In a startup you compress all this stress into three or four years.  You do tend to get a  certain  bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain, but you can't evade the fundamental conservation law. If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.<br><br><b>Millions, not Billions</b><br><br>If $3 million a year seems high to some people, it will seem low to others.  Three <i>million?</i>  How do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates?<br><br>So let's get Bill Gates out of the way right now.  It's not a good idea to use famous rich people  as examples, because the press only  write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers. Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man, but you need more than that to make as much money as he has.  You also need to be very lucky.<br><br>There is a large random factor in the success of any company.  So the guys you end  up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very  smart, totally dedicated, <i>and</i> win the lottery. Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also  happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for DOS.  No doubt Bill did  everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder,  and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if there had been one person with a brain on IBM's side, Microsoft's future would have been very different. Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM. They were effectively a component supplier.  If IBM had  required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft would still have signed the deal.  It would still have meant a lot of money for them,  and IBM could easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.<br><br>Instead IBM ended up using all its power in the market to give Microsoft control of the PC standard.  From  that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute.  They never had to bet the company on a bold decision.  All they had to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more innovative products reasonably promptly.<br><br>If IBM hadn't made this mistake, Microsoft would still have been a successful company, but it could not have grown so big so fast.  Bill Gates would be rich, but he'd be somewhere near the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.<br><br>There are a lot of ways to get rich, and this essay is about only one of them.  This essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and getting paid for it.  There are plenty of other ways to  get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance,  theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly, graft, lobbying, counterfeiting, and prospecting.  Most of the greatest fortunes have probably involved several of these.<br><br>The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich, is not just that it's more legitimate  (many of the other methods are now illegal)  but that it's more <i>straightforward.</i>  You just have to do something people want.<br><br><b>Money Is Not Wealth</b><br><br>If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is.   Wealth is not the same thing as money.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font>   Wealth is as old as human history.  Far older, in fact; ants have wealth.  Money is a comparatively recent invention.<br><br>Wealth is the fundamental thing.  Wealth is stuff we want: food,  clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places, and so on.  You can have wealth without having money.  If you had a magic machine that could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn't need money. Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is nothing to buy, it wouldn't matter how much money you had.<br><br>Wealth is what you want, not money.  But if wealth is the important thing, why does everyone talk about making money?   It is a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practice they are usually interchangeable.  But they are not the same thing, and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about <i>making money</i> can make it harder to understand how to  make money.<br><br>Money is a side effect of specialization. In a specialized society, most of the things you need, you can't make for yourself.  If you want a potato or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone else.<br><br>How do you get the person who grows the potatoes to give you some? By giving him something he wants in return.  But you can't get very far by trading things directly with the people who need them.  If you make violins, and none of the local farmers wants one, how will you eat?<br><br>The solution societies find, as they get more specialized, is to make the trade into a two-step process.  Instead of trading violins directly for potatoes, you trade violins for, say, silver,  which you can then trade again for anything else you need.  The intermediate stuff-- the <i>medium of exchange</i>-- can be anything that's rare and portable.  Historically metals have been the most common, but recently we've been using a medium of exchange, called the <i>dollar</i>, that doesn't physically exist.  It works as a medium of exchange, however, because its rarity  is guaranteed by the U.S. Government.<br><br>The advantage of a medium of exchange is that it makes trade work. The disadvantage is that it tends to obscure what trade really means.  People think that what a business does is make money. But money is just the intermediate stage-- just a shorthand-- for whatever people want. What most businesses really do is make   wealth.  They do something people want.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>The Pie Fallacy</b><br><br>A surprising number of people retain from childhood the idea that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world.  There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of <i>money</i> at  any moment.  But that's not the same thing.<br><br>When wealth is talked about in this context, it is often described as a pie.  "You can't make the pie larger," say politicians. When you're talking about the amount of money in one family's bank account, or the amount available to a government from one year's tax revenue, this is true.   If one person gets more, someone else has to get less.<br><br>I can remember believing, as a child, that if a few rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else. Many people seem to continue to believe something like this well into adulthood.  This fallacy is usually there in the  background when you hear someone talking about how x percent of the population have y percent of the wealth.  If you plan to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you're planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.<br><br>What leads people astray here is the abstraction of money.  Money is not wealth.  It's just something we use to move wealth around. So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to trade with other people for things you want, there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world.   <i>You can make more wealth.</i>  Wealth has been getting created and destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.<br><br>Suppose you own a beat-up old car.  Instead of sitting on your butt next summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition. In doing so you create wealth.  The world is-- and you specifically are-- one pristine old car the richer.  And not just in some metaphorical way.  If you sell your car, you'll get more for it.<br><br>In restoring your old car you have made yourself richer.  You haven't made anyone else poorer.  So there is obviously not a fixed pie.  And in fact, when you look at  it this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Kids know, without knowing they know, that they can create wealth.  If you need to give someone a present and don't have any money, you make one.  But kids are so bad at making things that they consider home-made presents to be a distinct, inferior, sort of thing to store-bought ones-- a mere expression of the proverbial thought that counts.  And indeed, the lumpy ashtrays we made for our parents did not have much of a resale market.<br><br><b>Craftsmen</b><br><br>The people most likely to grasp that wealth can be created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen. Their hand-made objects become store-bought ones.  But with the rise of industrialization there are fewer and fewer craftsmen.  One of the biggest remaining groups  is computer programmers.<br><br>A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and <i>create wealth</i>.  A good piece of software is, in itself,  a valuable thing. There is no manufacturing to confuse the issue.  Those characters you type  are a complete, finished product. If someone sat down and wrote a web browser that didn't suck (a fine idea, by the way), the world would be that much richer. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5bn"><font color="#777777">5b</font></a>]</font><br><br>Everyone in a company works together to create wealth, in the sense of making more things people want. Many of the employees (e.g. the people in the mailroom or the personnel department) work at one remove from the  actual making of stuff.  Not the programmers.  They literally think the product, one line at a time. And so it's clearer to programmers that wealth is something that's made, rather than being distributed, like slices of a pie, by some imaginary Daddy.<br><br>It's also obvious to programmers that there are huge variations in the rate at which wealth is created.  At Viaweb we had one programmer who was a sort of monster of productivity.   I remember watching what he did one long day and estimating that he had added several hundred thousand dollars to the market value of the company.  A great programmer, on a roll, could  create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks. A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).<br><br>This is why so many of the best programmers are libertarians. In our world, you sink or swim, and there are no excuses. When those far removed from the creation of wealth-- undergraduates, reporters, politicians-- hear that the richest 5% of the people have  half the total wealth, they tend to think <i>injustice!</i> An experienced programmer would be more likely to think <i>is that all?</i>  The top 5% of programmers probably write 99% of the good software.<br><br>Wealth can be created without being sold.  Scientists, till recently at least, effectively donated the wealth they  created.  We are all richer for knowing about penicillin, because we're less likely to die from infections.  Wealth is whatever people want, and not dying is certainly something we want.  Hackers often donate their work by  writing open source software that anyone can use for free. I am much the richer for the operating system FreeBSD, which I'm running on the computer I'm using now, and so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.<br><br><b>What a Job Is</b><br><br>In industrialized countries, people belong to one institution or another at least until their twenties.  After all those years you get used to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all get up in the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that they do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing.  Belonging to such a group becomes part of your identity: name, age, role, institution. If you have to introduce yourself, or someone else describes you, it will be as something like, John Smith, age 10, a student at such and such elementary school, or John Smith, age 20, a student at such and such college.<br><br>When John Smith finishes school he is expected to get a job.  And what getting a job seems to mean is joining another institution. Superficially it's a lot like college.  You pick the companies you want to work for and apply to join them.  If one likes you, you become a member of this new group.  You get up in the morning and go to a new set of buildings, and do things that you do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing.  There are a few differences: life is not as much fun, and you get paid, instead of paying, as you did in college.  But the similarities feel greater than the differences.  John Smith is now John Smith, 22, a software developer at such and such corporation.<br><br>In fact John Smith's life has changed more than he realizes.  Socially, a company looks much like college, but the deeper you go into the underlying reality, the more different it gets.<br><br>What a company does, and has to do if it wants to continue to exist, is earn money.  And the way most companies make money is by creating wealth.  Companies can be so specialized that this similarity is concealed, but it is not only manufacturing  companies that create wealth.  A big component of wealth is location.  Remember that magic machine that could make you cars and cook you dinner and so on?  It would not be so useful if it delivered your dinner to a random location in central Asia.   If wealth means what people want, companies that move things also create wealth.  Ditto for many other kinds of companies that don't make anything physical.  Nearly all companies exist to do something people want.<br><br>And that's what you do, as well, when you go to work for a company. But here there is another layer that tends to obscure the underlying reality.  In a company, the work you do is averaged together with a lot of other people's.   You may not even be aware you're doing something people want.  Your contribution may be indirect.  But the company as a whole must be giving people something they want, or they won't make any money.  And if they are paying you x dollars a year, then on average you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worth of work, or the company will be spending more than it makes, and will go out of business.<br><br>Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs to get a job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of  an institution.  A more direct way to put it would be: you need to start doing something people want.  You don't need to join a company to do that.  All a company is is a group of people working together to do something people want.  It's doing something people want that matters, not joining the group.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>For most people the    best plan probably is to go to work for some existing company.  But it is a good idea to understand what's happening    when you do this.  A job means doing something people want, averaged together with everyone else in that company.<br><br><b>Working Harder</b><br><br>That averaging gets to be a problem. I think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the    difficulty of assigning a value to each person's work.  For the most part they punt.  In a big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working  fairly hard.  You're expected not to be obviously incompetent or lazy, but you're not expected to devote your whole life to your work.<br><br>It turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your life you devote to your work.  In the right kind of business,   someone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten or even a hundred times as much wealth as an average employee.  A programmer, for example, instead of chugging along maintaining and updating an existing piece of software, could write a whole new piece of software, and with it create a new source of revenue.<br><br>Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this.  You can't go to your boss and say, I'd like to start working ten times as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much? For one thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as hard as you can.  But a more serious problem is that the company has no way of measuring the value of your work.<br><br>Salesmen are an exception.  It's easy  to measure how much revenue they generate, and they're usually paid a percentage of it.  If a salesman wants to work harder, he can just start doing it, and he will automatically get paid proportionally more.<br><br>There is one other job besides sales where big companies can hire first-rate people: in the top management jobs.  And for the same reason: their performance can be measured.  The top managers are held responsible for the performance of the entire company. Because an ordinary employee's performance can't usually be measured, he is not expected to do more than put in a solid effort.  Whereas top management, like salespeople, have to actually come up with the numbers. The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in   a solid effort.  If the company does badly, he's done badly.<br><br>A company that could pay all its employees so straightforwardly    would be enormously successful.  Many employees would work harder if they could get paid for it.  More importantly, such a company would attract people who wanted to work especially hard.  It would crush its competitors.<br><br>Unfortunately, companies can't pay everyone like salesmen.  Salesmen work alone.  Most employees' work is tangled together.  Suppose a company makes some kind of consumer gadget.  The  engineers build a reliable gadget with all kinds of new features; the industrial designers design a beautiful case for it; and then the marketing people convince everyone that it's something they've got to have.  How do you know how much of the gadget's sales are due to each group's efforts?  Or, for that matter, how much is due to the creators of past gadgets that gave the company a reputation for quality?  There's no way to   untangle all their contributions.  Even if you could read the minds of the consumers, you'd find these factors were all blurred together.<br><br>If you want to go faster, it's a problem to have your work tangled together with a large number of other people's.  In a   large group, your performance is not separately measurable-- and  the rest of the group slows you down.<br><br><b>Measurement and Leverage</b><br><br>To get rich you need to get yourself in a situation with two things, measurement and leverage.  You need to be in a position where your performance can be measured, or there is no way to get paid more by doing more.  And you have to have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have    a big effect.<br><br>Measurement alone is not enough.  An example of a job with measurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a sweatshop.  Your performance is measured and you get paid   accordingly, but you have no scope for decisions.  The only decision you get to make is how fast you work, and that can probably only increase your earnings by a factor of two or three.<br><br>An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would be lead actor in a movie.  Your performance can be measured in the gross of the movie.  And you have leverage in the sense that your performance can make or break it.<br><br>CEOs also have both measurement and leverage.  They're measured, in that the performance of the company is their performance. And they have leverage in that their decisions set the whole company moving in one direction or another.<br><br>I think everyone who gets rich by their own efforts will be found to be in a situation with measurement and leverage.     Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars,  hedge fund managers, professional athletes.  A good hint to the presence of leverage is the possibility of failure. Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is  big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying possibility of loss.  CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletes all live with the sword hanging over their heads; the moment they start to suck, they're out.  If you're in a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich, because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.<br><br>But you don't have to become a CEO or a movie star to be in a situation with measurement and leverage.  All you         need to do is be part of a small group working on a hard problem.<br><br><b>Smallness = Measurement</b><br><br>If you can't measure the value of the work done by individual   employees, you can get close.  You can measure the value of the work done by small groups.<br><br>One level at which you can accurately measure the revenue generated by employees is at the level of the whole company.    When the company is small, you are thereby fairly close to  measuring the contributions of individual employees.  A viable startup might only have ten employees, which puts you within a factor of ten of measuring individual effort.<br><br>Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as most people can get to saying to one's boss, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times as much.  There are two differences: you're not saying it to your boss, but directly to the customers (for whom your boss is only a proxy after all), and you're not doing it individually, but along with a small group of other ambitious people.<br><br>It will, ordinarily, be a group.  Except in a few unusual kinds of work, like acting or writing books, you can't be a company  of one person.   And the people you work with had better be good, because it's their work that yours is going to be averaged with.<br><br>A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers. Two things keep the speed of the galley down.  One is that individual rowers don't see any result from working harder.  The other is that, in a group of a thousand people, the average rower is likely  to be pretty average.<br><br>If you took ten people at random out of the big galley and put them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go   faster.  They would have both carrot and stick to motivate    them.  An energetic rower would be encouraged by the thought that he could have a visible effect on the speed of the boat.  And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely to notice and complain.<br><br>But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when  you take the ten <i>best</i> rowers out of the big galley and put them in a boat together.  They will have all the extra motivation that comes from being in a small group. But more importantly, by selecting that small a group you can get the best rowers.  Each one will be in the top 1%.  It's a much better deal for them to average   their work together with a small group of their peers than to     average it with everyone.<br><br>That's the real point of startups.  Ideally, you are getting together with a group of other people who also want to work a lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would in a big company.  And because startups tend to get founded  by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already  know one another (at least by reputation), the level of  measurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone. A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you.<br><br>Steve Jobs once said that the success or failure of a startup depends on the first ten employees.  I agree. If  anything, it's more like the first five. Being small is not, in itself, what makes startups kick butt,    but rather that small groups can be select. You don't want small in the sense of a village, but small in the sense of an all-star team.<br><br>The larger a group, the closer its average member will be to the average for the population as a whole.   So all other things being equal, a very able person in a big company is probably getting a bad deal, because his performance is dragged down by the overall lower performance of the others.  Of course, all other things often are not equal: the able person may  not care about money, or may prefer the stability of a large company.  But a very able person who does care about money will ordinarily do better to go off and work with a small group of peers.<br><br><b>Technology = Leverage</b><br><br>Startups offer anyone a way to be in a situation with measurement and leverage. They allow measurement because they're small, and they offer leverage because they make money by inventing new technology.<br><br>What is technology?  It's <i>technique</i>. It's the way   we all do things.  And when you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied by all the people who use it.  It is the proverbial fishing rod, rather than the fish.  That's the difference between a startup and a restaurant or a barber shop.  You fry eggs or cut  hair one customer at a time.  Whereas if  you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about, you help everyone who uses your solution.   That's leverage.<br><br>If you look at history, it seems that most people who got rich by creating wealth did it by developing new technology.  You just can't fry eggs or cut hair fast enough. What made the Florentines rich in 1200  was the discovery of new techniques for making the high-tech  product of the time, fine woven cloth.  What made the Dutch rich in 1600 was the discovery of shipbuilding and navigation techniques that enabled them to dominate the seas of the Far East.<br><br>Fortunately there is a natural fit between smallness and solving hard problems.  The leading edge of technology moves fast.  Technology that's valuable today could be worthless in a couple years.  Small companies are more at home in this world, because they don't have layers of bureaucracy to slow them down. Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches, and small companies are less constrained by convention.<br><br>Big companies can develop technology.  They just can't do it quickly.  Their size makes them slow and prevents them from rewarding employees for the extraordinary effort required.  So in practice big companies only get to develop  technology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups from competing with them, like microprocessors, power plants,  or passenger aircraft.  And even in those fields they depend heavily on startups for components and ideas.<br><br>It's obvious that biotech or software startups exist to solve hard technical problems, but  I think it will also be found to be true  in businesses that don't seem to be about technology.  McDonald's, for example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald's  franchise, that could then be reproduced at will all over the  face of the earth.  A McDonald's franchise is controlled by rules so precise that it is practically a piece of software.  Write once, run everywhere. Ditto for Wal-Mart.  Sam Walton got rich not by being a  retailer, but by designing a new kind of store.<br><br>Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting the overall aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way. At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was <i>run upstairs.</i> Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big, fat, bully.  You open a door and find yourself in a     staircase.  Do you go up or down?  I say up.  The bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can. Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage. Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.<br><br>What this meant in practice was that we deliberately sought       hard problems.  If there were two features we could add to our software, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty, we'd always take the harder one.  Not just because it was  more valuable, but <i>because it was harder.</i> We delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors to follow us over difficult ground. Like guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the mountains, where the troops of the central government can't follow.  I can remember times when we were just exhausted after wrestling all day with some horrible technical problem.  And I'd be delighted, because something that was  hard for us would be impossible for our competitors.<br><br>This is not just a good way to run a startup.  It's what a startup is. Venture capitalists know about this and have a phrase for it: <i>barriers to entry.</i>  If you go to a VC with a new  idea and ask him to invest in it, one of the first things he'll ask is, how hard would this be for someone else to   develop?  That is, how much difficult ground have you put between yourself and potential pursuers?  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font> And you had better have a convincing explanation of why  your technology would be hard to duplicate.  Otherwise as soon as some big company becomes aware of it, they'll make their own, and with their brand name, capital, and distribution clout, they'll take away your market overnight. You'd be like guerillas caught in the open field by regular army forces.<br><br>One way to put up barriers to entry is through patents.  But patents may not provide much protection.  Competitors commonly find ways to work around a patent. And if they can't, they  may simply violate it and invite you to sue them. A big company is not afraid to be sued; it's an everyday thing for them.  They'll make sure that suing them is expensive and takes a long time. Ever heard of Philo Farnsworth?  He invented television.  The reason you've never heard of him is that his company was not the one to make money from it.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font> The company that did was RCA, and Farnsworth's reward for his efforts was a decade of patent litigation.<br><br>Here, as so often, the best defense is a good offense.  If you can develop technology that's simply too hard for competitors to duplicate, you don't need to rely on other defenses.  Start by picking a hard problem, and then at every decision point, take the harder choice.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>The Catch(es)</b><br><br>If it were simply a matter of working harder than  an ordinary employee and getting paid proportionately, it would obviously be a good deal to start a startup.  Up to a point it would be more fun. I don't think many people  like the slow pace of big companies, the interminable meetings, the water-cooler conversations, the clueless middle managers, and so on.<br><br>Unfortunately there are a couple catches.  One is that you can't choose the point on the curve that you want to inhabit. You can't decide, for example, that you'd like to work just two or three times as hard, and get paid that much more.  When you're running a startup, your competitors decide how hard you work.  And they pretty much all make the same decision: as hard as you possibly can.<br><br>The other catch is that the payoff is only on average proportionate to your productivity.  There is, as I said before, a large random multiplier in the success of any company.  So in practice the deal is not that you're 30 times as productive and get  paid 30 times as much.  It is that you're 30 times as productive, and get paid between zero and a thousand times as much. If the mean is 30x, the median is probably zero. Most startups tank, and not just the dogfood  portals we all heard about during the Internet Bubble.  It's common for a startup to be developing a genuinely good product, take slightly too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.<br><br>A startup is like a mosquito.  A bear can absorb a hit and a crab is armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing: to score.  No energy is wasted on defense.  The defense of mosquitos,  as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little  consolation to the individual mosquito.<br><br>Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing proposition. And you don't generally know which of the two you're going to get till the last minute.  Viaweb came close to tanking several times. Our trajectory was like a sine wave.  Fortunately we got bought at the top of the cycle, but it was damned close.   While we were visiting Yahoo in California to talk about selling the company to them, we had to borrow a conference room to reassure an investor who was about to back out of a new round of funding  that we needed to stay alive.<br><br>The all-or-nothing aspect of startups was not something we wanted. Viaweb's hackers were all extremely risk-averse. If there had been some way just to work super hard and get paid for it, without having a lottery mixed in, we would have been delighted.  We would have much preferred a 100% chance of $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though  theoretically the second is worth twice as much.   Unfortunately, there is not currently any space in the business world where you can get the first deal.<br><br>The closest you can get is by selling your startup in the early stages, giving up upside   (and risk) for a smaller but guaranteed payoff.  We had a  chance to do this, and stupidly, as we then thought, let it slip by. After that we became comically eager to sell. For the next year or so, if anyone expressed the slightest curiosity about Viaweb we would try to sell them the company.  But there were no takers, so we had to keep going.<br><br>It would have been a bargain to  buy us at an early stage, but companies doing acquisitions are not looking for bargains.  A company big enough to acquire  startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and  within the company the people in charge of acquisitions will be among the more conservative, because they are likely to be business school types who joined the company late.   They would rather overpay for a safe choice.  So it is easier to sell an established startup, even at a large premium, than an early-stage one.<br><br><b>Get Users</b><br><br>I think it's a good idea to get bought, if you can.  Running a business is different from growing one. It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach  cruising altitude.  It's also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify. What would you think of a financial advisor who put all his client's assets into one volatile stock?<br><br>How do you get bought?  Mostly by doing the same things  you'd do if you didn't intend to sell the company.  Being  profitable, for example.   But getting bought is also an art in its own right, and one that we spent a lot of time trying to master.<br><br>Potential buyers will always delay if they can.  The hard part about getting bought is getting them to act.  For most people, the most powerful motivator is not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss.  For potential acquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that  one of their competitors will buy you.  This, as we found,  causes CEOs to take red-eyes.   The second biggest is the worry that, if they don't buy you  now, you'll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to acquire later, or even become a competitor.<br><br>In both cases, what it all comes down to is users.   You'd think that a company about to buy you would do a lot of research and decide for themselves how valuable your technology was.  Not at all.  What they go by is the number of users you have.<br><br>In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has the best technology.  And this is not as stupid as it sounds.  Users  are the only real proof that you've created wealth.  Wealth is  what people want, and if people aren't using your software, maybe it's not just because you're bad at marketing.  Maybe it's because you haven't made what they want.<br><br>Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch out for. Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are  obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead of making users happy.  In a startup, you're not just trying to solve problems.  You're trying to solve problems <i>that  users care about.</i><br><br>So I think you should make users the test, just as  acquirers do.  Treat a startup as an optimization problem  in which performance is measured by number of users.  As anyone who has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement. When you try to guess where your program is slow, and what would make it faster, you almost always guess wrong.<br><br>Number of users may not be the perfect test, but it will  be very close.  It's what acquirers care about.  It's what  revenues depend on.   It's what makes competitors unhappy. It's what impresses reporters, and potential new users.  Certainly it's a better test than your a priori notions of what problems are important to solve, no matter how technically adept you are.<br><br>Among other things, treating a startup as an optimization problem will help you avoid another pitfall that VCs worry about, and rightly-- taking a long time to develop a product.  Now we can recognize this as something hackers already know to avoid: premature optimization.  Get a version  1.0 out there as soon as you can.  Until you have some users to measure, you're optimizing based on guesses.<br><br>The ball you need to keep your eye on here is the underlying principle that wealth is what people want.  If you plan to get  rich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want.   So few businesses really pay attention to making customers happy. How often do you walk into a store, or call a company on the phone, with a feeling of dread in the back of your mind? When you hear "your call is important to us, please stay on the line," do you think, oh good, now everything will be all right?<br><br>A restaurant can afford to serve the occasional burnt dinner. But in technology, you cook one thing and that's what everyone eats.  So any difference between what people want and what you deliver is multiplied.   You please or annoy customers wholesale.  The closer you can get to what they want, the more wealth you generate.<br><br><b>Wealth and Power</b><br><br>Making wealth is not the only way to get rich.  For most of human history it has not even been the most common.  Until a few centuries ago, the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs, land, and cattle, and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance, marriage, conquest, or confiscation.   Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.<br><br>Two things changed.  The first was the rule of law.  For most of the world's history, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his  henchmen  would find a way to steal it. But in medieval Europe something new happened. A new class of merchants and manufacturers began to collect in towns.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#777777">10</font></a>]</font> Together they were able to withstand the local feudal lord.  So  for the first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the nerds' lunch money. This was naturally a great incentive, and possibly indeed the main cause of the second big change, industrialization.<br><br>A great deal has been written about the causes of the Industrial  Revolution.  But surely a necessary, if not sufficient, condition was that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them in peace. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#777777">11</font></a>]</font> One piece of evidence is what happened to countries that tried to return to the old model, like the Soviet Union, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor governments of the 1960s and early 1970s.  Take away the incentive of wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt.<br><br>Remember what a startup is, economically:  a way of saying, I want to work faster.  Instead of accumulating money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I  want to get it over with as soon as possible.  So governments that forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeing that you work slowly.  They're willing to let you earn $3 million over fifty years, but they're not willing to let you work so hard that you can do it in two.  They are like the corporate boss that you can't go to and say, I want to work ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times a much. Except this is not a boss you can escape by starting your own company.<br><br>The problem with working slowly is not just that technical innovation happens slowly.  It's that it tends not to happen at all. It's only when you're deliberately looking for hard problems, as a way to use speed to the greatest advantage, that you take on this kind of project.  Developing new technology is a  pain in the ass. It is, as Edison said, one percent  inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.   Without the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it. Engineers will work on sexy projects like fighter planes and moon rockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologies like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs.<br><br>Startups are not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in  the last couple decades.  Since it became possible to get rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has used essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage, where measurement comes from working with a small group, and leverage from developing new techniques. The recipe was the same in Florence in 1200 as it is  in Santa Clara today.<br><br>Understanding this may help to answer an important question: why Europe grew so powerful. Was it something about the geography of  Europe?  Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior? Was it their religion?  The answer (or at least the proximate cause) may be that the Europeans  rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who made a lot of money to keep it.<br><br>Once you're allowed to do that,  people who want to get rich can do it by generating wealth instead of stealing it. The resulting technological growth translates not only  into wealth but into military power.  The theory that led to the stealth plane was developed by a Soviet mathematician. But because the Soviet Union didn't have a computer industry, it remained for them a theory; they didn't have hardware capable of executing the calculations fast enough to design an actual airplane.<br><br>In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as World War II and, for that matter, most wars in recent history. Don't let a ruling class of warriors and politicians squash the entrepreneurs. The same recipe that makes individuals rich makes countries powerful.  Let the nerds keep their lunch money, and you rule the world.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] One valuable thing you tend to get only in startups is <i>uninterruptability</i>.  Different kinds of work have different time quanta.  Someone proofreading a manuscript could probably be interrupted every fifteen minutes with little loss of productivity.  But the time quantum for hacking is very long: it might take an hour just to load a problem into your head.  So the cost of having someone from personnel call you about a form you forgot to fill out can be huge.<br><br>This is why hackers give you such a baleful stare as they turn from their screen to answer your question.  Inside their heads a giant house of cards is tottering.<br><br>The mere possibility of being interrupted deters hackers from starting hard projects.  This is why they tend to work late at night, and why it's next to impossible to write great software in a cubicle (except late at night).<br><br>One great advantage of startups is that they don't yet have any of the people who interrupt you.  There is no personnel department, and thus no form nor anyone to call you about it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] Faced with the idea that people working for startups might be 20 or 30 times as productive as those working for large companies, executives at large companies will naturally wonder, how could I get the people working for me to do that?  The answer is simple: pay them to.<br><br>Internally most companies are run like Communist states.

Adam Smith (<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, v:i) mentions several that tried to preserve their "wealth" by forbidding the export of gold or silver. But having more of the medium of exchange would not make a country richer; if you have more money chasing the same amount of material wealth, the only result is higher prices.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>] There are many senses of the word "wealth," not all of them material.  I'm not trying to make a deep philosophical point here about which is the true kind.  I'm writing about one specific, rather technical sense of the word "wealth."  What people will give you money for. This is an interesting sort of wealth to study, because it is the kind that prevents you from starving. And what people will give you money for depends on them, not you.<br><br>When you're starting a business, it's easy to slide into thinking that customers want what you do.  During the Internet Bubble I talked to a woman who, because she liked the outdoors, was starting an "outdoor portal." You know what kind of business you should start if you like the outdoors?  One to recover data from crashed hard disks.<br><br>What's the connection?  None at all.  Which is precisely my point. If you want to create wealth (in the narrow technical sense of not starving) then you should be especially skeptical about any plan that centers on things you like doing. That is where your idea of what's valuable is least likely to coincide with other people's.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>] In the average car restoration you probably do make everyone else microscopically poorer, by doing a small amount of damage to the environment.  While environmental costs should be taken into account, they don't make wealth a zero-sum game.  For example, if you repair a machine that's broken because a part has come unscrewed, you create wealth with no environmental cost.<br><br>[<a name="f5bn"><font color="#000000">5b</font></a>] This essay was written before Firefox.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>] Many people feel confused and depressed in their early twenties.  Life seemed so much more fun in college. Well, of course it was.  Don't be fooled by the surface similarities. You've gone from guest to servant. It's possible to have fun in this new world.  Among other things, you now get to go behind the doors that say "authorized personnel only." But the change is a shock at first, and all the worse if you're not consciously aware of it.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>] When VCs asked us how long it would take another startup to duplicate our software, we used to reply that they probably wouldn't be able to at all. I think this made us seem naive, or liars.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>] Few technologies have one clear inventor.  So as a rule, if you know the "inventor" of something (the telephone, the assembly line, the airplane,  the light bulb, the transistor) it is because their company made money from it, and the company's PR people worked hard to spread the story.  If you don't know who invented something (the automobile, the television, the computer, the jet engine, the laser), it's because other companies made all the money.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>] This is a good plan for life in general. If you have two choices, choose the harder. If you're trying to decide whether to go out running or sit home and watch TV, go running. Probably the reason this trick works so well is that when you have two choices and one is harder, the only reason you're even considering the other is laziness. You know in the back of your mind what's the right thing to do, and this trick merely forces you to acknowledge it.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>] It is probably no accident that the middle class first appeared in northern Italy and the low countries, where there were no strong central governments.   These two regions were the richest of their time and became the twin centers from which Renaissance civilization radiated. If they no longer play that role, it is because other places, like the United States, have been truer to the principles they discovered.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>] It may indeed be a sufficient condition.  But if so, why didn't the Industrial Revolution happen earlier?  Two possible (and not incompatible) answers: (a) It did.   The Industrial Revolution was one in a series. (b) Because in medieval towns, monopolies and guild regulations initially slowed the development of new means of production.<br><br><a href="http://reddit.com"><img src="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/redditino.png" border="0"></a> <a href="http://reddit.com/info?id=20775"> Comment</a> on this essay.<br><br><br><br><script language="javascript" src="http://tipjoy.com/buttonGen?targetUser=pg&amp;targetUrl=http://paulgraham.com/wealth.html&amp;title=How%20to%20Make%20Wealth" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" hspace="0" vspace="0" allowtransparency="true"></script><br><br></p></font>

Most startups that fail do it because they fail at one of these.  A startup that does all three will probably succeed.<br><br>And that's kind of exciting, when you think about it, because all three are doable.  Hard, but doable.  And since a startup that succeeds ordinarily makes its founders rich, that implies getting rich is doable too.  Hard, but doable.<br><br>If there is one message I'd like to get across about startups, that's it.  There is no magically difficult step that requires brilliance to solve.<br><br><b>The Idea</b><br><br>In particular, you don't need a brilliant  <a href="ideas.html">idea</a> to start a startup around.   The way a startup makes money is to offer people better technology than they have now.  But what people have now is often so bad that it doesn't take brilliance to do better.<br><br>Google's plan, for example, was simply to create a search site that didn't suck.  They had three new ideas: index more of the Web, use links to rank search results, and have clean, simple web pages with unintrusive keyword-based ads.  Above all, they were determined to make a site that was good to use.  No doubt there are great technical tricks within Google, but the overall plan was straightforward. And while they probably have bigger ambitions now, this alone brings them a billion dollars a year. [1]<br><br>There are plenty of other areas that are just as backward as search was before Google.  I can think of several heuristics for generating ideas for startups, but most reduce to this: look at something people are trying to do, and figure out how to do it in a way that doesn't suck.<br><br>For example, dating sites currently suck far worse than search did before Google.  They all use the same simple-minded model. They seem to have approached the problem by thinking about how to do database matches instead of how dating works in the real world. An undergrad could build something better as a class project.  And yet there's a lot of money at stake.  Online dating is a valuable business now, and it might be worth a hundred times as much if it worked.<br><br>An idea for a startup, however, is only a beginning.  A lot of would-be startup founders think the key to the whole process is the initial idea, and from that point all you have to do is execute. Venture capitalists know better.  If you go to VC firms with a brilliant idea that you'll tell them about if they sign a nondisclosure agreement, most will tell you to get lost.   That shows how much a  mere idea is worth. The market price is less than the inconvenience  of signing an NDA.<br><br>Another sign of how little the initial idea is worth is the number of startups that change their plan en route. Microsoft's original plan was to make money selling programming languages, of all things. Their current business model didn't occur to them until IBM dropped it in their lap five years later.<br><br>Ideas for startups are worth something, certainly, but the trouble is, they're not transferrable.  They're not something you could hand to someone else to execute.  Their value is mainly as starting points: as questions for the people who had them to continue thinking about.<br><br>What matters is not ideas, but the people who have them.  Good people can fix bad ideas, but good ideas can't save bad people.   <!-- So let's talk about people. --><br><br><b>People</b><br><br>What do I mean by good people?  One of the best tricks I learned    during <a href="road.html">our</a> startup was a rule for deciding  who to hire.  Could you describe the person as an animal?  It might be hard to translate    that into another language, but I think everyone in the US knows   what it means.  It means someone who takes their work a little too    seriously; someone who does what they do so well that they pass right through professional and cross over into obsessive.<br><br>What it means specifically depends on the job: a salesperson who just won't take no for an answer; a hacker who will stay up till    4:00 AM rather than go to bed leaving code with a bug in it; a PR    person who will cold-call <i>New York Times</i> reporters on their cell phones; a graphic designer who feels physical pain when something  is two millimeters out of place.<br><br>Almost everyone who worked for us was an animal at what they did.  The woman in charge of sales was so tenacious that I used to feel sorry for potential customers on the phone with her.  You could   sense them squirming on the hook, but you knew there would be no   rest for them till they'd signed up.<br><br>If you think about people you know, you'll find the animal test is easy to apply.  Call the person's image to mind and imagine the sentence "so-and-so is an animal."  If you laugh, they're not.  You don't need or perhaps even want this quality in big companies, but you need it in a startup.<br><br>For programmers we had three additional tests.  Was the person genuinely smart?  If so, could they actually get things done?  And finally, since a few good hackers have unbearable personalities,    could we stand to have them around?<br><br>That last test filters out surprisingly few people.  We could bear any amount of nerdiness if someone was truly smart.  What we couldn't stand were people with a lot of attitude.  But most of those weren't truly smart, so our third test was largely a restatement of the first.<br><br>When nerds are unbearable it's usually because they're trying too hard to seem smart.  But the smarter they are, the less pressure they feel to act smart.  So as a rule you can recognize genuinely smart people by their ability to say things like "I don't know,"    "Maybe you're right," and "I don't understand x well enough."<br><br>This technique doesn't always work, because people can be influenced by their environment.  In the MIT CS department, there seems to be a tradition of acting like a brusque know-it-all. I'm told it derives ultimately from Marvin Minsky, in the same way the classic airline pilot manner is said to derive from Chuck Yeager.  Even genuinely smart people start to act this way there, so you have to make allowances.<br><br>It helped us to have Robert Morris, who is one of the readiest to say "I don't know" of anyone I've met.  (At least, he was before he  became a professor at MIT.)  No one dared put on attitude around    Robert, because he was obviously smarter than they were and yet had zero attitude himself.<br><br>Like most startups, ours began with a group of friends, and it was through personal contacts that we got most of the people we hired. This is a crucial difference between startups and big companies. Being friends with someone for even a couple days will tell you  more than companies could ever learn in interviews.  [2]<br><br>It's no coincidence that startups start around universities, because that's where smart people meet.  It's not what people learn in     classes at MIT and Stanford that has made technology companies spring up around them.  They could sing campfire songs in the classes so long as admissions worked the same.<br><br>If you start a startup, there's a good chance it will be with people you know from college or grad school.  So in theory you ought to   try to make friends with as many smart people as you can in school, right?  Well, no.  Don't make a conscious effort to schmooze; that doesn't work well with hackers.<br><br>What you should do in college is work on your own projects.  Hackers should do this even if they don't plan to start startups, because  it's the only real way to learn how to program.   In some cases you may collaborate with other students, and this is the best way to get to know good hackers.  The project may even grow into a startup. But once again, I wouldn't aim too directly at either target.  Don't force things; just work on stuff you like with people you like.<br><br>Ideally you want between two and four founders.  It would be hard to start with just one.  One person would find the moral weight of starting a company hard to bear.  Even Bill Gates, who seems to be    able to bear a good deal of moral weight, had to have a co-founder.  But you don't want so many founders that the company starts to look like a group photo.  Partly because you don't need a lot of people at first, but mainly because the more founders you have, the worse disagreements you'll have. When there are just two or three founders, you know you have to resolve disputes immediately or perish.  If there are seven or eight, disagreements can linger and harden into factions.  You don't want mere voting; you need unanimity.<br><br>In a technology startup, which most startups are, the founders should include technical people.   During the Internet Bubble there  were a number of startups founded by business people who then went looking for hackers to create their product for them.  This doesn't   work well.  Business people are bad at deciding what to do with    technology, because they don't know what the options are, or which kinds of problems are hard and which are easy.  And when business people try to hire hackers, they can't tell which ones are  <a href="gh.html">good</a>. Even other hackers have a hard time doing that.  For business people it's roulette.<br><br>Do the founders of a startup have to include business people?  That depends.  We thought so when we started ours, and we asked several  people who were said to know about this mysterious thing called "business" if they would be the president.  But they all said no, so I had to do it myself.  And what I discovered was that business was no great mystery.   It's not something like physics or medicine that requires extensive study.  You just try to get people to pay you for stuff.<br><br>I think the reason I made such a mystery of business was that I was disgusted by the idea of doing it.  I wanted to work in the pure,    intellectual world of software, not deal with customers' mundane   problems.  People who don't want to get dragged into some kind of work often develop a protective incompetence at it.  Paul Erdos was particularly good at this.  By seeming unable even to cut a grapefruit in half (let alone go to the store and buy one), he forced other people to do such things for him, leaving all his time free for math.  Erdos was an extreme case, but most husbands use the same   trick to some degree.<br><br>Once I was forced to discard my protective incompetence, I found that business was neither so hard nor so boring as I feared.  There are esoteric areas of business that are quite hard, like tax law or the pricing of derivatives, but you don't need to know about    those in a startup.  All you need to know about business to run a   startup are commonsense things people knew before there were business schools, or even universities.<br><br>If you work your way down the Forbes 400 making an x next to the    name of each person with an MBA, you'll learn something important about business school.  After Warren Buffett, you don't hit another  MBA till number 22, Phil Knight, the CEO of Nike.  There are only 5 MBAs in the top 50.  What you notice in the Forbes 400 are a lot of people with       technical backgrounds.  Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, Michael Dell, Jeff Bezos, Gordon Moore.  The rulers of the technology business tend to come from technology, not business.  So if you    want to invest two years in something that will help you succeed   in business, the evidence suggests you'd do better to learn how to    hack than get an MBA. [3]<br><br>There is one reason you might want to include business people in a startup, though: because you have to have at least one person willing and able to focus on what customers want. Some believe only business people can do this-- that hackers can implement software, but not    design it.  That's nonsense.  There's nothing about knowing how to program that prevents hackers from understanding users, or about not knowing how to program that magically enables business people  to understand them.<br><br>If you can't understand users, however, you should either learn how or find a co-founder who can.  That is the single most important issue for technology startups, and the rock that sinks more of them than anything else.<br><br><b>What Customers Want</b><br><br>It's not just startups that have to worry about this.  I think most businesses that fail do it because they don't give customers what they want.  Look at restaurants.  A large percentage fail, about a quarter in the first year.  But can you think of one restaurant that had really good food and went out of business?<br><br>Restaurants with great food seem to prosper no matter what.  A     restaurant with great food can be expensive, crowded, noisy, dingy, out of the way, and even have bad service, and people will keep coming.  It's true that a restaurant with mediocre food can sometimes  attract customers through gimmicks.  But that approach is very   risky.  It's more straightforward just to make the food good.<br><br>It's the same with technology.  You hear all kinds of reasons why startups fail.  But can you think of one that had a massively popular product and still failed?<br><br>In nearly every failed startup, the real problem was that customers didn't want the product.  For most, the cause of death is listed   as "ran out of funding," but that's only the immediate cause.  Why  couldn't they get more funding?  Probably because the product was a dog, or never seemed likely to be done, or both.<br><br>When I was trying to think of the things every startup needed to    do, I almost included a fourth: get a version 1 out as soon as you can.  But I decided not to, because that's implicit in making something customers want.  The only way to make something customers want is to get a prototype in front of them and refine it based on    their reactions.<br><br>The other approach is what I call the "Hail Mary" strategy.  You   make elaborate plans for a product, hire a team of engineers to    develop it (people who do this tend to use the term "engineer" for    hackers), and then find after a year that you've spent two million dollars to develop something no one wants.  This was not uncommon during the Bubble, especially in companies run by business types,  who thought of software development as something terrifying that therefore had to be carefully planned.<br><br>We never even considered that approach.  As a Lisp hacker, I come  from the tradition of rapid prototyping.  I would not claim (at least, not here) that this is the right way to write every program, but it's certainly the right way to write software for a startup. In a startup, your initial plans are almost certain to be wrong in some way, and your first priority should be to figure out where.    The only way to do that is to try implementing them.<br><br>Like most startups, we changed our plan on the fly.  At first we expected our customers to be Web consultants.  But it turned out they didn't like us, because our software was easy to use and we hosted the site.  It would be too easy for clients to fire them.  We also thought we'd be able to sign up a lot of catalog companies, because selling online was a natural extension of their existing business. But in 1996 that was a hard sell.  The middle managers we talked    to at catalog companies saw the Web not as an opportunity, but as something that meant more work for them.<br><br>We did get a few of the more adventurous catalog companies.  Among them was Frederick's of Hollywood, which gave us valuable experience dealing with heavy loads on our servers.  But most of our users    were small, individual merchants who saw the Web as an opportunity  to build a business.  Some had retail stores, but many only existed online.  And so we changed direction to focus on these users. Instead of concentrating on the features Web consultants and catalog companies would want, we worked to make the software easy to use.<br><br>I learned something valuable from that.  It's worth trying very,  very hard to make technology easy to use.  Hackers are so used to computers that they have no idea how horrifying software seems to normal people.  Stephen Hawking's editor told him that every equation he included in his book would cut sales in half.  When you work on making technology easier to use, you're riding that curve up instead   of down. A 10% improvement in ease of use doesn't just increase     your sales 10%.  It's more likely to double your sales.<br><br>How do you figure out what customers want?  Watch them.  One of the best places to do this was at trade shows.  Trade shows didn't pay  as a way of getting new customers, but they were worth it as market research.  We didn't just give canned presentations at trade shows. We used to show people how to build real, working stores.  Which    meant we got to watch as they used our software, and talk to them     about what they needed.<br><br>No matter what kind of startup you start, it will probably be a    stretch for you, the founders, to understand what users want.  The only kind of software you can build without studying users is the     sort for which you are the typical user.  But this is just the kind that tends to be open source: operating systems, programming languages, editors, and so on.  So if you're developing technology for money, you're probably not going to be developing it for people like you.  Indeed, you can use this as a way to generate ideas for startups: what do people who are not like you want from technology?<br><br>When most people think of startups, they think of companies like Apple or Google.  Everyone knows these, because they're big consumer brands.  But for every startup like that, there are twenty more   that operate in niche markets or live quietly down in the infrastructure. So if you start a successful startup, odds are you'll start one of  those.<br><br>Another way to say that is, if you try to start the kind of startup that has to be a big consumer brand, the odds against succeeding are steeper.  The best odds are in niche markets.  Since startups   make money by offering people something better than they had before, the best opportunities are where things suck most.  And it would    be hard to find a place where things suck more than in corporate   IT departments.  You would not believe the amount of money companies spend on software, and the crap they get in return.  This imbalance equals opportunity.<br><br>If you want ideas for startups, one of the most valuable things you could do is find a middle-sized non-technology company and spend a   couple weeks just watching what they do with computers.  Most good hackers have no more idea of the horrors perpetrated in these places than rich Americans do of what goes on in Brazilian slums.<br><br>Start by writing software for smaller companies, because it's easier to sell to them.  It's worth so much to sell stuff to big companies that the people selling them the crap they currently use spend a lot of time and money to do it.  And while you can outhack Oracle with one frontal lobe tied behind your back, you can't outsell an Oracle salesman.  So if you want to win through better technology, aim at smaller customers.  [4]<br><br>They're the more strategically valuable part of the market anyway.     In technology, the low end always eats the high end.  It's easier   to make an inexpensive product more powerful than to make a powerful product cheaper.  So the products that start as cheap, simple options tend to gradually grow more powerful till, like water rising in a   room, they squash the "high-end" products against the ceiling.  Sun did this to mainframes, and Intel is doing it to Sun.  Microsoft Word did it to desktop publishing software like Interleaf and Framemaker.  Mass-market digital cameras are doing it to the expensive models made for professionals.  Avid did it to the manufacturers      of specialized video editing systems, and now Apple is doing it to Avid.  <i>Henry Ford</i> did it to the car makers that preceded him.  If you build the simple, inexpensive option, you'll not only find it easier to sell at first, but you'll also be in the best    position to conquer the rest of the market.<br><br>It's very dangerous to let anyone fly under you.  If you have the cheapest, easiest product, you'll own the low end.  And if you don't, you're in the crosshairs of whoever does.<br><br><b>Raising Money</b><br><br>To make all this happen, you're going to need money.  Some startups have been self-funding-- Microsoft for example-- but most aren't. I think it's wise to take money from investors.  To be self-funding, you have to start as a consulting company, and it's hard to switch from that to a product company.<br><br>Financially, a startup is like a pass/fail course.  The way to get rich from a startup is to maximize the company's chances of succeeding, not to maximize the amount of stock you retain.  So if you can trade stock for something that improves your odds, it's probably a smart  move.<br><br>To most hackers, getting investors seems like a terrifying and mysterious process.  Actually it's merely tedious.  I'll try to give an outline of how it works.<br><br>The first thing you'll need is a few tens of thousands of dollars    to pay your expenses while you develop a prototype.  This is called seed capital.  Because so little money is involved, raising seed capital is comparatively easy-- at least in the sense of getting a quick yes or no.<br><br>Usually you get seed money from individual rich people called "angels." Often they're people who themselves got rich from technology. At the seed stage, investors don't expect you to have an elaborate business plan.  Most know that they're supposed to decide quickly. It's not unusual to get a check within a week based on a half-page agreement.<br><br>We started Viaweb with $10,000 of seed money from our friend Julian. But he gave us a lot more than money.  He's a former CEO and also a corporate lawyer, so he gave us a lot of valuable advice about business, and also did all the legal work of getting us set up as a company.  Plus he introduced us to one of the two  angel investors who supplied our next round of funding.<br><br>Some angels, especially those with technology backgrounds, may be      satisfied with a demo and a verbal description of what you plan to  do.  But many will want a copy of your business plan, if only to remind themselves what they invested in.<br><br>Our angels asked for one, and looking back, I'm amazed how much worry it caused me.  "Business plan" has that word "business" in it, so I figured it had to be something I'd have to read a book about business plans to write.  Well, it doesn't.  At this stage, all most investors expect is a brief description of what you plan     to do and how you're going to make money from it, and the resumes  of the founders.  If you just sit down and write out what you've been saying to one another, that should be fine.  It shouldn't take more than a couple hours, and you'll probably find that writing it all down gives you more ideas about what to do.<br><br>For the angel to have someone to make the check out to, you're going to have to have some kind of company.  Merely incorporating yourselves isn't hard.  The problem is, for the company to exist, you have to decide who the founders are, and how much stock they each have.  If there are two founders with the same qualifications who are both equally committed to the business, that's easy.  But if you have a number of people who are expected to contribute in varying degrees, arranging the proportions of stock can be hard.  And once you've done it, it tends to be set in stone.<br><br>I have no tricks for dealing with this problem.  All I can say is, try hard to do it right.  I do have a rule of thumb for recognizing when you have, though.  When everyone feels they're getting a slightly bad deal, that they're doing more than they should for the amount of stock they have, the stock is optimally apportioned.<br><br>There is more to setting up a company than incorporating it, of course: insurance, business license, unemployment compensation,     various things with the IRS.  I'm not even sure what the list is, because we, ah, skipped all that.  When we got real funding near the end of 1996, we hired a great CFO, who fixed everything    retroactively.  It turns out that no one comes and arrests you if you don't do everything you're supposed to when starting a company. And a good thing too, or a lot of startups would never get started. [5]<br><br>It can be dangerous to delay turning yourself into a company, because one or more of the founders might decide to split off and start    another company doing the same thing.  This does happen.  So when you set up the company, as well as as apportioning the stock, you should get all the founders to sign something agreeing that everyone's ideas belong to this company, and that this company is going to be everyone's only job.<br><br>[If this were a movie, ominous music would begin here.]<br><br>While you're at it, you should ask what else they've signed.  One of the worst things that can happen to a startup is to run into        intellectual property problems.  We did, and it came closer to  killing us than any competitor ever did.<br><br>As we were in the middle of getting bought, we discovered that one of our people had, early on, been bound by an agreement that said all his ideas belonged to the giant company that was paying for him to go to grad school.  In theory, that could have meant someone else owned big chunks of our software.  So the acquisition came to a screeching halt while we tried to sort this out.  The problem       was, since we'd been about to be acquired, we'd allowed ourselves  to run low on cash.  Now we needed to raise more to keep going.  But it's hard to raise money with an IP cloud over your head, because investors can't judge how serious it is.<br><br>Our existing investors, knowing that we needed money and had nowhere else to get it, at this point attempted certain gambits which I will not describe in detail, except to remind readers that the word    "angel" is a metaphor.  The founders thereupon proposed to walk    away from the company, after giving the investors a brief tutorial  on how to administer the servers themselves.  And while this was happening, the acquirers used the delay as an excuse to welch on   the deal.<br><br>Miraculously it all turned out ok.  The investors backed down; we did another round of funding at a reasonable valuation; the giant company finally gave us a piece of paper saying they didn't own our software; and six months later we were bought by Yahoo for much more than the earlier acquirer had agreed to pay.  So we were happy in the end, though the experience probably took several years off   my life.<br><br>Don't do what we did.  Before you consummate a startup, ask  everyone about their previous IP history.<br><br>Once you've got a company set up, it may seem presumptuous to go knocking on the doors of rich people and asking them to invest tens of thousands of dollars in something that is really just a bunch  of guys with some ideas.  But when you look at it from the rich people's point of view, the picture is more encouraging. Most rich  people are looking for good investments.  If you really think you have a chance of succeeding, you're doing them a favor by letting them invest.  Mixed with any annoyance they might feel about being    approached will be the thought: are these guys the next Google?<br><br>Usually angels are financially equivalent to founders.  They get  the same kind of stock and get diluted the same amount in future rounds.  How much stock should they get?  That depends on how ambitious you feel.  When you offer x percent of your company for y dollars, you're implicitly claiming a certain value for the whole company.  Venture investments are usually described in terms of that number.  If you give an investor new shares equal to 5% of those already outstanding in return for $100,000, then you've done the deal at a pre-money valuation of $2 million.<br><br>How do you decide what the value of the company should be?  There is no rational way.  At this stage the company is just a bet.  I didn't realize that when we were raising money.  Julian thought we ought to value the company at several million  dollars.  I thought it was preposterous to claim that a couple thousand lines of code, which was all we had at the time, were worth several million dollars.  Eventually we settled on one millon, because Julian said no one would invest in a company with a valuation any lower. [6]<br><br>What I didn't grasp at the time was that the valuation wasn't just    the value of the code we'd written so far.  It was also the value of our ideas, which turned out to be right, and of all the future work we'd do, which turned out to be a lot.<br><br>The next round of funding is the one in which you might deal with  actual  <a href="venturecapital.html">venture capital firms</a>.   But don't wait till you've burned    through your last round of funding to start approaching them.  VCs are slow to make up their minds.  They can take months.  You don't want to be  running out of money while you're trying to negotiate with them.<br><br>Getting money from an actual VC firm is a bigger deal than getting money from angels.  The amounts of money involved are larger, millions usually.  So the deals take longer, dilute you more, and impose more onerous conditions.<br><br>Sometimes the VCs want to install a new CEO of their own choosing.  Usually the claim is that you need someone mature and experienced, with a business background.  Maybe in some cases this is true.   And yet Bill Gates was young and inexperienced and had no business  background, and he seems to have done ok.  Steve Jobs got booted out of his own company by someone mature and experienced, with a business background, who then proceeded to ruin the company.  So I think people who are mature and experienced, with a business background, may be overrated.  We used to call these guys "newscasters," because they had neat hair and spoke in deep, confident voices, and generally didn't know much more than they read on the teleprompter.<br><br>We talked to a number of VCs, but eventually we ended up financing our startup entirely with angel money.  The main reason was that      we feared a brand-name VC firm would stick us with a newscaster as part of the deal.  That might have been ok if he was content to limit himself to talking to the press, but what if he wanted to   have a say in running the company?   That would have led to disaster, because our software was so complex.  We were a company whose whole m.o. was to win through better technology.  The strategic decisions were mostly decisions about technology, and we didn't need any help with those.<br><br>This was also one reason we didn't go public.  Back in 1998 our CFO tried to talk me into it.  In those days you could go public as a dogfood portal, so as a company with a real product and real revenues, we might have done well.  But I feared it would have meant taking on a newscaster-- someone who, as they say, "can talk Wall Street's language."<br><br>I'm happy to see Google is bucking that trend.  They didn't talk Wall Street's language when they did their IPO, and Wall Street didn't buy.  And now Wall Street is collectively kicking itself. They'll pay attention next time.  Wall Street learns new languages    fast when money is involved.<br><br>You have more leverage negotiating with VCs than you realize.  The    reason is other VCs.  I know a number of VCs now, and when you talk to them you realize that it's a seller's market.  Even now there is too much money chasing too few good deals.<br><br>VCs form a pyramid.  At the top are famous ones like Sequoia and Kleiner Perkins, but beneath those are a huge number you've never  heard of.  What they all have in common is that a dollar from them  is worth one dollar.  Most VCs will tell you that they don't just  provide money, but connections and advice.  If you're talking to   Vinod Khosla or John Doerr or Mike Moritz, this is true.  But such advice and connections can come very expensive.  And as you go down the food chain the VCs get rapidly  <!-- href="http://ricksegal.typepad.com/pmv/2005/03/vcs_suck_shocki.html"--> dumber.  A few steps down from  the top you're basically talking to bankers who've picked up a few new vocabulary words from reading <i>Wired</i>.  (Does your product use <i>XML?</i>)  So I'd advise you to be skeptical about claims of experience and connections.  Basically, a VC is a source of money.  I'd be inclined to go with whoever offered the most money   the soonest with the least strings attached.<br><br>You may wonder how much to tell VCs.  And you should, because some of them may one day be funding your competitors.  I think the best plan is not to be overtly secretive, but not to tell them everything either.  After all, as most VCs say, they're more interested in the people than the ideas.  The main reason they want to talk about your idea is to judge you, not the idea.  So as long as you seem like you know what you're doing, you can probably keep a few things back from them. [7]<br><br>Talk to as many VCs as you can, even if you don't want their money, because a) they may be on the board of someone who will buy you,      and b) if you seem impressive, they'll be discouraged from investing in your competitors.  The most efficient way to reach VCs, especially if you only want them to know about you and don't want their money, is at the conferences that are occasionally organized for startups    to present to them.<br><br><b>Not Spending It</b><br><br>When and if you get an infusion of real money from investors, what should you do with it?  Not spend it, that's what.  In nearly every    startup that fails, the proximate cause is running out of money.  Usually there is something deeper wrong.  But even a proximate cause of death is worth trying hard to avoid.<br><br>During the Bubble many startups tried to "get big fast." Ideally this meant getting a lot of customers fast.  But it was easy for the meaning to slide over into hiring a lot of people fast.<br><br>Of the two versions, the one where you get a lot of customers fast is of course preferable.  But even that may be overrated.  The idea is to get there first and get all the users, leaving none for competitors.  But I think in most businesses the advantages of being first to market are not so overwhelmingly great.  Google is again a case in point.  When they appeared it seemed as if search was a mature market, dominated by big players who'd spent millions to build their brands: Yahoo, Lycos, Excite, Infoseek, Altavista,   Inktomi.  Surely 1998 was a little late to arrive at the party.<br><br>But as the founders of Google knew, brand is worth next to nothing in the search business.  You can come along at any point and make  something better, and users will gradually seep over to you.  As   if to emphasize the point, Google never did any advertising.  They're like dealers; they sell the stuff, but they know better than to use it themselves.<br><br>The competitors Google buried would have done better to spend those millions improving their software.  Future startups should learn from that mistake.  Unless you're in a market where products are    as undifferentiated as cigarettes or vodka or laundry detergent, spending a lot on brand advertising is a sign of breakage.  And few if any Web businesses are so undifferentiated.  The dating sites   are running big ad campaigns right now, which is all the  more evidence they're ripe for the picking.  (Fee, fie, fo, fum, I   smell a company run by marketing guys.)<br><br>We were compelled by circumstances to grow slowly, and in retrospect it was a good thing.  The founders all learned to do every job in   the company.  As well as writing software, I had to do sales and customer support.  At sales I was not very good.  I was persistent, but I didn't have the smoothness of a good salesman.  My message    to potential customers was: you'd be stupid not to sell online, and   if you sell online you'd be stupid to use anyone else's software.    Both statements were true, but that's not the way to convince people.<br><br>I was great at customer support though.  Imagine talking to a customer support person who not only knew everything about the product, but would apologize abjectly if there was a bug, and then fix it immediately, while you were on the phone with them.  Customers loved us.  And we loved them, because when you're growing slow by word of mouth, your first batch of users are the ones who were smart enough to find you by themselves.  There is nothing more valuable, in the early stages of a startup, than smart users.  If you listen to them, they'll tell you exactly how to make a winning product.       And not only will they give you this advice for free, they'll pay you.<br><br>We officially launched in early 1996.  By the end of that year we had about 70 users.  Since this was the era of "get big fast," I worried about how small and obscure we were.  But in fact we were doing exactly the right thing.  Once you get big (in users or employees) it gets hard to change your product.  That year was effectively a laboratory for improving our software.  By the end   of it, we were so far ahead of our competitors that they never had  a hope of catching up.  And since all the hackers had spent many hours talking to users, we understood online commerce way better than anyone else.<br><br>That's the key to success as a startup.  There is nothing more  important than understanding your business.  You might think that anyone in a business must, ex officio, understand it.  Far from it.    Google's secret weapon was simply that they understood search.  I was working for  Yahoo when Google appeared, and Yahoo didn't understand search.  I know because I once tried to convince the powers that be that we had to make search better, and I got in reply what was then the party line about it: that Yahoo was no longer a mere "search engine." Search was now only a small percentage of our page views, less than one month's growth, and now that we were established as a "media    company," or "portal," or whatever we were, search could safely be allowed to wither and drop off, like an umbilical cord.<br><br>Well, a small fraction of page views they may be, but they are an   important fraction, because they are the page views that Web sessions   start with.  I think Yahoo gets that now.<br><br>Google understands a few other things most Web companies still don't.  The most important is that you should put users before advertisers, even though the advertisers are paying and users aren't. One of my favorite bumper stickers reads "if the people lead, the   leaders will follow." Paraphrased for the Web, this becomes "get all the users, and the advertisers will follow."  More generally, design your product to please users first, and then think about how to make money from it.  If you don't put users first, you leave a     gap for competitors who do.<br><br>To make something users love, you have to understand them.  And the bigger you are, the harder that is.  So I say "get big slow." The slower you burn through your funding, the more time you have to learn.<br><br>The other reason to spend money slowly is to encourage a culture  of cheapness.  That's something Yahoo did understand.  David Filo's  title was "Chief Yahoo," but he was proud that his unofficial title was "Cheap Yahoo."  Soon after we arrived at Yahoo, we got an email from Filo, who had been crawling around our directory hierarchy,       asking if it was really necessary to store so much of our data on expensive RAID drives.  I was impressed by that.  Yahoo's market cap then was already in the billions, and they were still worrying about wasting a few gigs of disk space.<br><br>When you get a couple million dollars from a VC firm, you tend to feel rich.  It's important to realize you're not.  A rich company is one with large revenues.  This money isn't revenue.  It's money investors have given you in the hope you'll be able to generate    revenues.  So despite those millions in the bank, you're still poor.<br><br>For most startups the model should be grad student, not law firm. Aim for cool and cheap, not expensive and impressive.  For us the test of whether a startup understood this was whether they had Aeron chairs.  The Aeron came out during the Bubble and was very popular with startups.  Especially the type, all too common then, that was like a bunch of kids playing house with money supplied by VCs.   We    had office chairs so cheap that the arms all fell off.  This was  slightly embarrassing at the time, but in retrospect the grad-studenty atmosphere of our office was another of those things we did right  without knowing it.<br><br>Our offices were in a wooden triple-decker in Harvard Square.  It had been an apartment until about the 1970s, and there was still a    claw-footed bathtub in the bathroom.  It must once have been inhabited by someone fairly eccentric, because a lot of the chinks in the     walls were stuffed with aluminum foil, as if to protect against    cosmic rays.  When eminent visitors came to see us, we were a bit sheepish about the low production values.  But in fact that place was the perfect space for a startup.  We felt like our role was to  be impudent underdogs instead of corporate stuffed shirts, and that     is exactly the spirit you want.<br><br>An apartment is also the right kind of place for developing software. Cube farms suck for that, as you've probably discovered if you've tried it.  Ever notice how much easier it is to hack at home than at work?  So why not make work more like home?<br><br>When you're looking for space for a startup, don't feel that it has to look professional.  Professional means doing good work, not elevators and glass walls.  I'd advise most startups to avoid corporate space at first and just rent an apartment.  You want to live at the office in a startup, so why not have a place designed to be lived in as your office?<br><br>Besides being cheaper and better to work in, apartments tend to be in better locations than office buildings.  And for a startup location is very important.  The key to productivity is for people to come back to work after dinner.  Those hours after the phone stops ringing are by far the best for getting work done.  Great things happen when a group of employees go out to dinner together,  talk over ideas, and then come back to their offices to implement   them.  So you want to be in a place where there are a lot of restaurants around, not some dreary office park that's a wasteland after 6:00 PM.  Once a company shifts over into the model where  everyone drives home to the suburbs for dinner, however late, you've lost something extraordinarily valuable.  God help you if you actually start in that mode.<br><br>If I were going to start a startup today, there are only three    places I'd consider doing it: on the Red Line near Central, Harvard, or Davis Squares (Kendall is too sterile); in Palo Alto on University or California Aves; and in Berkeley immediately north or south of    campus.  These are the only places I know that have the right kind of vibe.<br><br>The most important way to not spend money is by not hiring people.   I may be an extremist, but I think hiring people is the worst thing a company can do.  To start with, people are a recurring expense,  which is the worst kind.  They also tend to cause you to grow out      of your space, and perhaps even move to the sort of uncool office building that will make your software worse.  But worst of all, they slow you down: instead of sticking your head in someone's     office and checking out an idea with them, eight people have to have a meeting about it.  So the fewer people you can hire, the better.<br><br>During the Bubble a lot of startups had the opposite policy.  They wanted to get "staffed up" as soon as possible, as if you couldn't  get anything done unless there was someone with the corresponding  job title.  That's big company thinking.  Don't hire people to fill the gaps in some a priori org chart.  The only reason to hire someone is to do something you'd like to do but can't.<br><br>If hiring unnecessary people is expensive and slows you down, why do nearly all companies do it?  I think the main reason is that people like the idea of having a lot of people working for them. This weakness often extends right up to the CEO.  If you ever end up running a company, you'll find the most common question people ask is how many employees you have.  This is their way of weighing you.  It's not just random people who ask this; even reporters do. And they're going to be a lot more impressed if the answer is a thousand than if it's ten.<br><br>This is ridiculous, really.  If two companies have the same revenues, it's the one with fewer employees that's more impressive.  When   people used to ask me how many people our startup had, and I answered "twenty," I could see them thinking that we didn't count for much. I used to want to add "but our main competitor, whose ass we regularly kick, has a hundred and forty, so can we have credit for the larger of the two numbers?"<br><br>As with office space, the number of your employees is a choice  between seeming impressive, and being impressive.  Any of you who   were <a href="nerds.html">nerds</a> in high school know about this  choice.  Keep doing it when you start a company.<br><br><b>Should You?</b><br><br>But should you start a company?  Are you the right sort of person to do it?  If you are, is it worth it?<br><br>More people are the right sort of person to start a startup than realize it.  That's the main reason I wrote this.  There could be    ten times more startups than there are, and that would probably be a good thing.<br><br>I was, I now realize, exactly the right sort of person to start a    startup.  But the idea terrified me at first.  I was forced into    it because I was a <a href="icad.html">Lisp</a> hacker.  The company I'd been consulting for seemed to be running into trouble, and there   were not a lot of other companies using Lisp.  Since I couldn't   bear the thought of programming in another language (this was 1995, remember, when "another language" meant C++) the only option seemed to be to start a new company using Lisp.<br><br>I realize this sounds far-fetched, but if you're a Lisp hacker you'll know what I mean.  And if the idea of starting a startup frightened me so much that I only did it out of necessity, there   must be a lot of people who would be good at it but who are too     intimidated to try.<br><br>So who should start a startup?  Someone who is a good hacker, between about 23 and 38, and who wants to solve the money problem in one shot instead of getting paid gradually over a conventional working life.<br><br>I can't say precisely what a good hacker is.  At a first rate    university this might include the top half of computer science    majors.  Though of course you don't have to be a CS major to be a hacker; I was a philosophy major in college.<br><br>It's hard to tell whether you're a good hacker, especially when you're young.  Fortunately the process of starting startups tends to select them automatically.  What drives people to start startups is (or should be) looking at existing technology and thinking, don't  these guys realize they should be doing x, y, and z?  And that's  also a sign that one is a good hacker.<br><br>I put the lower bound at 23 not because there's something that doesn't happen to your brain till then, but because you need to see what it's like in an existing business before you try running your own.  The business doesn't have to be a startup.  I spent a year working for a software company to pay off my college loans.  It was the worst year of my adult life, but I learned, without realizing   it at the time, a lot of valuable lessons about the software business. In this case they were mostly negative lessons: don't have a lot of meetings; don't have chunks of code that multiple people own; don't have a sales guy running the company; don't make a high-end product; don't let your code get too big; don't leave finding bugs to QA people; don't go too long between releases; don't isolate developers from users; don't move from Cambridge to Route 128; and so on. [8] But negative lessons are just as valuable as positive  ones.  Perhaps even more valuable: it's hard to repeat a brilliant performance, but it's straightforward to avoid errors. [9]<br><br>The other reason it's hard to start a company before 23 is that      people won't take you seriously.  VCs won't trust you, and will try to reduce you to a mascot as a condition of funding.  Customers will worry you're going to flake out and leave them stranded.  Even you yourself, unless you're very unusual, will feel your age to      some degree; you'll find it awkward to be the boss of someone much  older than you, and if you're 21, hiring only people younger rather  limits your options.<br><br>Some people could probably start a company at 18 if they wanted to. Bill Gates was 19 when he and Paul Allen started Microsoft.  (Paul  Allen was 22, though, and that probably made a difference.) So if you're thinking, I don't care what he says, I'm going to start a company now, you may be the sort of person who could get away with it.<br><br>The other cutoff, 38, has a lot more play in it.  One reason I put  it there is that I don't think many people have the physical stamina much past that age.   I used to work till 2:00 or 3:00 AM every night, seven days a week.  I don't know if I could do that now.<br><br>Also, startups are a big risk financially.  If you try something that blows up and leaves you broke at 26, big deal; a lot of 26 year olds are broke.  By 38 you can't take so many risks-- especially if you have kids.<br><br>My final test may be the most restrictive.  Do you actually want to start a startup?  What it amounts to, economically, is compressing your working life into the smallest possible space.  Instead of working at an ordinary rate for 40 years, you work like hell for  four.  And maybe end up with nothing-- though in that case it probably won't take four years.<br><br>During this time you'll do little but work, because when you're not working, your competitors will be.  My only leisure activities were running, which I needed to do to keep working anyway, and about fifteen minutes of reading a night.  I had a girlfriend for a total of two months during that three year period.  Every couple weeks I would take a few hours off to visit a used bookshop or go to a   friend's house for dinner.  I went to visit my family twice. Otherwise I just worked.<br><br>Working was often fun, because the people I worked with were some of my best friends.  Sometimes it was even technically interesting. But only about 10% of the time.  The best I can say for the other 90% is that some of it is funnier in hindsight than it seemed then. Like the time the power went off in Cambridge for about six hours, and we made the mistake of trying to start a gasoline powered generator inside our offices. I won't try that again.<br><br>I don't think the amount of bullshit you have to deal with in a startup is more than you'd endure in an ordinary working life.  It's probably less, in fact; it just seems like a lot because it's        compressed into a short period.  So mainly what a startup buys you  is time.  That's the way to think about it if you're trying to  decide whether to start one.  If you're the sort of person who would like to solve the money problem once and for all instead of working  for a salary for 40 years, then a startup makes sense.<br><br>For a lot of people the conflict is between startups and graduate school.  Grad students are just the age, and just the sort of people, to start software startups.  You may worry that if you do you'll    blow your chances of an academic career.  But it's possible to be   part of a startup and stay in grad school, especially at first.   Two of our three original hackers were in grad school the whole  time, and both got their <a href="tlbphd.html">degrees</a>.  There are few sources of energy so powerful as a procrastinating grad student.<br><br>If you do have to leave grad school, in the worst case it won't be for too long.  If a startup fails, it will probably fail quickly enough that you can  return to academic life.  And if it succeeds, you may find you no    longer have such a burning desire to be an assistant professor.<br><br>If you want to do it, do it.  Starting a startup is not the great mystery it seems from outside.  It's not something you have to know about "business" to do.  Build something users love, and spend less than you make.  How hard is that?<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] Google's revenues are about two billion a year, but half comes from ads on other sites.<br><br>[2] One advantage startups have over established companies is that there are no discrimination laws about starting businesses.  For    example, I would be reluctant to start a startup with a woman who had small children, or was likely to have them soon.  But you're not allowed to ask prospective employees if they plan to have kids  soon.  Believe it or not, under current US law, you're not even    allowed to discriminate on the basis of intelligence.  Whereas when you're starting a company, you can discriminate on any basis you want about who you start it with.<br><br>[3] Learning to hack is a lot cheaper than business school, because you can do it mostly on your own.  For the price of a Linux box, a copy of K&amp;R, and a few hours of advice from your neighbor's fifteen year old son, you'll be well on your way.<br><br>[4] Corollary: Avoid starting a startup to sell things to the biggest company of all, the government.  Yes, there are lots of opportunities to sell them technology.  But let someone else start those startups.<br><br>[5] A friend who started a company in Germany told me they do care  about the paperwork there, and that there's more of it.  Which helps explain why there are not more startups in Germany.<br><br>[6] At the seed stage our valuation was in principle $100,000, because Julian got 10% of the company.  But this is a very misleading number, because the money was the least important of the things Julian gave us.<br><br>[7] The same goes for companies that seem to want to acquire you. There will be a few that are only pretending to in order to pick your brains.  But you can never tell for sure which these are, so the best approach is to seem entirely open, but to fail to mention a few critical technical secrets.<br><br>[8]  I was as bad an employee as this place was a company.  I apologize to anyone who had to work with me there.<br><br>[9]  You could probably write a book about how to succeed in business by doing everything in exactly the opposite way from the DMV.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this essay, and to Steve Melendez and Gregory Price for inviting me to speak.<br><br></p></font>

Average age of their founders: 24.  So it is pretty well established now that grad students can start successful companies.  And if grad students can do it, why not undergrads?<br><br>Like everything else in technology, the cost of starting a startup has decreased dramatically.  Now it's so low that it has disappeared into the noise. The main cost of starting a Web-based startup is food and rent.  Which means it doesn't cost much more to start a company than to be a total slacker.  You can probably start a startup on ten thousand dollars of seed funding, if you're prepared to live on ramen.<br><br>The less it costs to start a company, the less you need the permission of investors to do it.  So a lot of people will be able to start companies now who never could have before.<br><br>The most interesting subset may be those in their early twenties. I'm not so excited about founders who have everything investors want except intelligence, or everything except energy.  The most promising group to be liberated by the new, lower threshold are those who have everything investors want except experience.<br><br><b>Market Rate</b><br><br>I once claimed that <a href="nerds.html">nerds</a> were unpopular in secondary school mainly because they had better things to do than work full-time at being popular.  Some said I was just telling people what they wanted to hear.  Well, I'm now about to do that in a spectacular way: I think undergraduates are undervalued.<br><br>Or more precisely, I think few realize the huge spread in the value of 20 year olds.  Some, it's true, are not very capable.  But others are more capable than all but a handful of 30 year olds. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Till now the problem has always been that it's difficult to pick them out.  Every VC in the world, if they could go back in time, would try to invest in Microsoft.  But which would have then?  How many would have understood that this particular 19 year old was Bill Gates?<br><br>It's hard to judge the young because (a) they change rapidly, (b) there is great variation between them, and (c) they're individually inconsistent.  That last one is a big problem.  When you're young, you occasionally say and do stupid things even when you're smart. So if the algorithm is to filter out people who say stupid things, as many investors and employers unconsciously do, you're going to get a lot of false positives.<br><br>Most organizations who hire people right out of college are only aware of the average value of 22 year olds, which is not that high.   And so the idea for most of the twentieth century was that everyone had to begin as a trainee in some  <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=158756&amp;cid=13299057">entry-level</a> job.  Organizations   realized there was a lot of variation in the incoming stream, but instead of pursuing this thought they tended to suppress it, in the belief that it was good for even the most promising kids to start  at the bottom, so they didn't get swelled heads.<br><br>The most productive young people will <i>always</i> be undervalued by large organizations, because the young have no performance to measure yet, and any error in guessing their ability will tend  toward the mean.<br><br>What's an especially productive 22 year old to do?  One thing you    can do is go over the heads of organizations, directly to the users. Any company that hires you is, economically, acting as a proxy for the customer.  The rate at which they value you (though they may not consciously realize it) is an attempt to guess your value to   the user.  But there's a way to appeal their judgement.  If you want, you can opt to be valued directly by users, by starting your own company.<br><br>The market is a lot more discerning than any employer.  And it is completely non-discriminatory.  On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog.  And more to the point, nobody knows you're 22.  All users care about is whether your site or software gives them what they want.  They don't care if the person behind it is a high school  kid.<br><br>If you're really productive, why not make employers pay market rate for you?  Why go work as an ordinary employee for a big company, when you could start a startup and make them buy it to get you?<br><br>When most people hear the word "startup," they think of the famous  ones that have gone public.  But most startups that succeed do it by getting bought.  And usually the acquirer doesn't just want the technology, but the people who created it as well.<br><br>Often big companies buy startups before they're profitable.  Obviously in such cases they're not after revenues.  What they want is the   development team and the software they've built so far.  When a startup gets bought for 2 or 3 million six months in, it's really more of a hiring bonus than an acquisition.<br><br>I think this sort of thing will happen more and more, and that it  will be better for everyone.  It's obviously better for the people who start the startup, because they get a big chunk of money up front.  But I think it will be better for the acquirers too.  The central problem in big companies, and the main reason they're so  much less productive than small companies, is the difficulty of valuing each person's work.  Buying larval startups solves that    problem for them: the acquirer doesn't pay till the developers have proven themselves.  Acquirers are protected on the downside, but    still get most of the upside.<br><br><b>Product Development</b><br><br>Buying startups also solves another problem afflicting big companies: they can't do product development.  Big companies are good at extracting the value from existing products, but bad at creating    new ones.<br><br>Why? It's worth studying this phenomenon in detail, because this   is the raison d'etre of startups.<br><br>To start with, most big companies have some kind of turf to protect, and this tends to warp their development decisions.  For example, <a href="road.html">Web-based</a> applications are hot now, but within Microsoft there must be a lot of ambivalence about them, because the very idea of Web-based software threatens the desktop.  So any Web-based application that   Microsoft ends up with, will probably, like Hotmail, be something    developed outside the company.<br><br>Another reason big companies are bad at developing new products is that the kind of people who do that tend not to have much power in big companies (unless they happen to be the CEO).  Disruptive technologies are developed by disruptive people.  And they either don't work for the big company, or have been outmaneuvered by yes-men and have comparatively little influence.<br><br>Big companies also lose because they usually only build one of each thing.  When you only have one Web browser, you can't do anything really risky with it.  If ten different startups design ten different Web browsers and you take the best, you'll probably get something better.<br><br>The more general version of this problem is that there are too many new ideas for companies to explore them all.  There might be 500    startups right now who think they're making something Microsoft might buy.  Even Microsoft probably couldn't manage 500 development projects in-house.<br><br>Big companies also don't pay people the right way.  People developing a new product at a big company get paid roughly the same whether it succeeds or fails.  People at a startup expect to get rich if the product succeeds, and get nothing if it fails. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font>  So naturally the people at the startup work a lot harder.<br><br>The mere bigness of big companies is an obstacle.  In startups,   developers are often forced to talk directly to users, whether they want to or not, because there is no one else to do sales and support. It's painful doing sales, but you learn much more from trying to sell people something than reading what    they said in focus groups.<br><br>And then of course, big companies are bad at product development  because they're bad at everything.  Everything happens slower in big companies than small ones, and product development is something that has to happen fast, because you have to go through a lot of    iterations to get something good.<br><br><b>Trend</b><br><br>I think the trend of big companies buying startups will only accelerate.  One of the biggest remaining obstacles is pride.  Most   companies, at least unconsciously, feel they ought to be able to develop stuff in house, and that buying startups is to some degree  an admission of failure.  And so, as people generally do with admissions of failure, they put it off for as long as possible. That makes the acquisition very expensive when it finally happens.<br><br>What companies should do is go out and discover startups when they're young, before VCs have puffed them up into something that costs hundreds of millions to acquire.  Much of what VCs add, the acquirer doesn't need anyway.<br><br>Why don't acquirers try to predict the companies they're going to have to buy for hundreds of millions, and grab them early for a      tenth or a twentieth of that?  Because they can't predict the winners in advance?  If they're only paying a twentieth as much, they only have to predict a twentieth as well.  Surely they can manage that.<br><br>I think companies that acquire technology will gradually learn to  go after earlier stage startups.  They won't necessarily buy them outright.  The solution may be some hybrid of investment and acquisition: for example, to buy a chunk of the company and get an option to buy the rest later.<br><br>When companies buy startups, they're effectively fusing recruiting  and product development.  And I think that's more efficient than  doing the two separately, because you always get people who are really committed to what they're working on.<br><br>Plus this method yields teams of developers who already work well together.  Any conflicts between them have been ironed out under    the very hot iron of running a startup.  By the time the acquirer   gets them, they're finishing one another's sentences.  That's   valuable in software, because so many bugs occur at the boundaries  between different people's code.<br><br><b>Investors</b><br><br>The increasing cheapness of starting a company doesn't just give hackers more power relative to employers.  It also gives them more  power relative to investors.<br><br>The conventional wisdom among VCs is that hackers shouldn't be    allowed to run their own companies.  The founders are supposed to   accept MBAs as their bosses, and themselves take on some title like   Chief Technical Officer.  There may be cases where this is a good  idea.  But I think founders will increasingly be able to push back in the matter of control, because they just don't need the investors' money as much as they used to.<br><br>Startups are a comparatively new phenomenon.  Fairchild Semiconductor is considered the first VC-backed startup, and they were founded    in 1959, less than fifty years ago.  Measured on the time scale of    social change, what we have now is pre-beta.  So we shouldn't assume the way startups work now is the way they have to work.<br><br>Fairchild needed a lot of money to get started.  They had to build actual factories.  What does the first round of venture funding for a Web-based startup get spent on today?  More money can't get software written faster; it isn't needed for facilities, because those can now be quite cheap; all money can really buy you is sales and marketing.  A sales force is worth something, I'll admit.  But marketing is increasingly irrelevant.  On the Internet, anything genuinely good will spread by word of mouth.<br><br>Investors' power comes from money.  When startups need less money,    investors have less power over them.  So future founders may not have to accept new CEOs if they don't want them.  The VCs will have  to be dragged kicking and screaming down this road, but like many things people have to be dragged kicking and screaming toward, it may actually be good for them.<br><br>Google is a sign of the way things are going.  As a condition of funding, their investors insisted they hire someone old and experienced as CEO.  But from what I've heard the founders didn't just give in and take whoever the VCs wanted.  They delayed for an entire year, and when they did finally take a CEO, they chose a guy with a PhD  in computer science.<br><br>It sounds to me as if the founders are still the most powerful people in the company, and judging by Google's performance, their youth and inexperience doesn't seem to have hurt them.  Indeed, I suspect Google has done better than they would have if the founders had given the VCs what they wanted, when they wanted it, and let  some MBA take over as soon as they got their first round of funding.<br><br>I'm not claiming the business guys installed by VCs have no value. Certainly they have.  But they don't need to become the founders' bosses, which is what that title CEO means.  I predict that in the  future the executives installed by VCs will increasingly be COOs rather than CEOs.  The founders will run engineering directly, and the rest of the company through the COO.<br><br><b>The Open Cage</b><br><br>With both employers and investors, the balance of power is slowly shifting towards the young.  And yet they seem the last to realize it.  Only the most ambitious undergrads even consider starting their own company when they graduate.  Most just want to get a job.<br><br>Maybe this is as it should be.  Maybe if the idea of starting a   startup is intimidating, you filter out the uncommitted.  But I     suspect the filter is set a little too high.  I think there are people who could, if they tried, start successful startups, and who instead let themselves be swept into the intake ducts of big companies.<br><br>Have you ever noticed that when animals are let out of cages, they don't always realize at first that the door's open?  Often they have to be poked with a stick to get them out.  Something similar   happened with blogs.  People could have been publishing online in     1995, and yet blogging has only really taken off in the last couple years.  In 1995 we thought only professional writers were entitled to publish their ideas, and that anyone else who did was a crank. Now publishing online is becoming so popular that everyone wants   to do it, even print journalists.  But blogging has not taken off   recently because of any technical innovation; it just took eight years for everyone to realize the cage was open.<br><br>I think most undergrads don't realize yet that the economic cage   is open.  A lot have been told by their parents that the route to success is to get a good job.  This was true when their parents were in college, but it's less true now. The route to success is to build something valuable, and you don't have to be working for     an existing company to do that.  Indeed, you can often do it better if you're not.<br><br>When I talk to undergrads, what surprises me most about them is how conservative they are.   Not politically, of course.  I mean they don't seem to want to take risks.  This is a mistake, because the younger you are, the more risk you can take.<br><br><b>Risk</b><br><br>Risk and reward are always proportionate.  For example, stocks are riskier than bonds, and over time always have greater returns.  So why does anyone invest in bonds?  The catch is that phrase "over time."  Stocks will generate greater returns over thirty years, but they might lose value from year to year.  So what you should invest in depends on how soon you need the money.  If you're young, you  should take the riskiest investments you can find.<br><br>All this talk about investing may seem very theoretical.  Most undergrads probably have more debts than assets.  They may feel they have nothing to invest.  But that's not true: they have their time to invest, and the same rule about risk applies there.  Your early twenties are exactly the time to take insane career risks.<br><br>The reason risk is always proportionate to reward is that market   forces make it so.  People will pay extra for stability.  So if you choose stability-- by buying bonds, or by going to work for a big company-- it's going to cost you.<br><br>Riskier career moves pay better on average, because there is less demand for them.  Extreme choices like starting a startup are so   frightening that most people won't even try.  So you don't end up    having as much competition as you might expect, considering the prizes at stake.<br><br>The math is brutal.  While perhaps 9 out of 10 startups fail, the   one that succeeds will pay the founders more than 10 times what they would have made in an ordinary job. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font> That's the sense in which startups pay better "on average."<br><br>Remember that.  If you start a startup, you'll probably fail.  Most startups fail. It's the nature of the business.  But it's not necessarily a mistake to try something that has a 90% chance of failing, if you can afford the risk.  Failing at 40, when you have  a family to support, could be serious.  But if you fail at 22, so     what?  If you try to start a startup right out of college and it    tanks, you'll end up at 23 broke and a lot smarter.  Which, if you think about it, is roughly what you hope to get from a graduate   program.<br><br>Even if your startup does tank, you won't harm your prospects with employers.  To make sure I asked some friends who work for big companies.  I asked managers at Yahoo, Google, Amazon, Cisco and Microsoft how they'd feel about two candidates, both 24, with equal ability, one who'd tried to start a startup that tanked, and another who'd spent the two years since college working as a developer at a big company.  Every one responded that they'd prefer the guy who'd tried to start his own company.  Zod Nazem, who's in charge of        engineering at Yahoo, said:   </p> <blockquote> I actually put more value on the guy with the failed   startup.  And you can quote me!  </blockquote> So there you have it.  Want to get hired by Yahoo?  Start your own  company.<br><br><b>The Man is the Customer</b><br><br>If even big employers think highly of young hackers who start companies, why don't more do it?  Why are undergrads so conservative? I think it's because they've spent so much time in institutions.<br><br>The first twenty years of everyone's life consists of being piped from one institution to another.  You probably didn't have much choice about the secondary schools you went to.  And after high school it was probably understood that you were supposed to go to college.  You may have had a few different colleges to choose between, but they were probably pretty similar.  So by this point you've been riding on a subway line for twenty years, and the next stop seems to be a job.<br><br>Actually college is where the line ends.  Superficially, going to work for a company may feel like just the next in a series of       institutions, but underneath, everything is different.  The end of school is the fulcrum of your life, the point where you go from    net consumer to net producer.<br><br>The other big change is that now, you're steering.  You can go anywhere you want. So it may be worth standing back and understanding what's going on, instead of just doing the default thing.<br><br>All through college, and probably long before that, most undergrads  have been thinking about what employers want.  But what really  matters is what customers want, because they're the ones who give employers the money to pay you.<br><br>So instead of thinking about what employers want, you're probably better off thinking directly about what users want.  To the extent  there's any difference between the two, you can even use that to your advantage if you start a company of your own.  For example, big companies like docile conformists.  But this is merely an artifact of their bigness, not something customers need.<br><br><b>Grad School</b><br><br>I didn't consciously realize all this when I was graduating from    college-- partly because I went straight to grad school.  Grad school can be a pretty good deal, even if you think of one day    starting a startup.  You can start one when you're done, or even pull the ripcord part way through, like the founders of Yahoo and Google.<br><br>Grad school makes a good launch pad for startups, because you're collected together with a lot of smart people, and you have bigger  chunks of time to work on your own projects than an undergrad or corporate employee would.  As long as you have a fairly tolerant advisor, you can take your time developing an idea before turning    it into a company.  David Filo and Jerry Yang started the Yahoo       directory in February 1994 and were getting a million hits a day by the fall, but they didn't actually drop out of grad school and start a company till March 1995.<br><br>You could also try the startup first, and if it doesn't work, then go to grad school.  When startups tank they usually do it fairly quickly. Within a year you'll know if you're wasting your time.<br><br>If it fails, that is.  If it succeeds, you may have to delay grad school a little longer.  But you'll have a much more enjoyable life   once there than you would on a regular grad student stipend.<br><br><b>Experience</b><br><br>Another reason people in their early twenties don't start startups is that they feel they don't have enough experience.  Most investors feel the same.<br><br>I remember hearing a lot of that word "experience" when I was in   college.  What do people really mean by it?  Obviously it's not the experience itself that's valuable, but something it changes in your brain.  What's different about your brain after you have "experience," and can you make that change happen faster?<br><br>I now have some data on this, and I can tell you what tends to be  missing when people lack experience.  I've said that every  <a href="start.html">startup</a> needs three things: to start with good people, to make something users want, and not to spend too much money.  It's the middle one you get wrong when you're inexperienced.  There are    plenty of undergrads with enough technical skill to write good software, and undergrads are not especially prone to waste money. If they get something wrong, it's usually not realizing they have    to make something people <a href="bronze.html">want</a>.<br><br>This is not exclusively a failing of the young.  It's common for startup founders of all ages to build things no one wants.<br><br>Fortunately, this flaw should be easy to fix.  If undergrads were   all bad programmers, the problem would be a lot harder.  It can  take years to learn how to program.  But I don't think it takes  years to learn how to make things people want.  My hypothesis is that all you have to do is smack hackers on the side of the head and tell them: Wake up.  Don't sit here making up a priori theories about what users need.  Go find some users and see what they need.<br><br>Most successful startups not only do something very specific, but   solve a problem people already know they have.<br><br>The big change that "experience" causes in your brain is learning that you need to solve people's problems.  Once you grasp that, you advance quickly to the next step, which is figuring out what those problems are.  And that takes some effort, because the way software actually gets used, especially by the people who pay the most for it, is not at all what you might expect.  For example, the stated   purpose of Powerpoint is to present ideas.  Its real role is to  overcome people's fear of public speaking.  It allows you to give an impressive-looking talk about nothing, and it causes the audience to sit in a dark room looking at slides, instead of a bright one      looking at you.<br><br>This kind of thing is out there for anyone to see.  The key is to know to look for it-- to realize that having an idea for a startup is not like having an idea for a class project.  The goal in a startup is not to write a cool piece of software.  It's to make  something people want.  And to do that you have to look at users-- forget about hacking, and just look at users.  This can be quite a mental adjustment, because little if any of the software you write in school even has users.  <!-- Imagine the shock you'd feel if you spent eight years practicing football drills and only then had to play against an opposing team.  That's the scale of adjustment involved. --><br><br>A few steps before a Rubik's Cube is solved, it still looks like a mess.  I think there are a lot of undergrads whose brains are in a   similar position: they're only a few steps away from being able to start successful startups, if they wanted to, but they don't realize it.  They have more than enough technical skill.  They just haven't realized yet that the way to create wealth is to make what users    want, and that employers are just proxies for users in which risk   is pooled.<br><br>If you're young and smart, you don't need either of those.  You don't need someone else to tell you what users want, because you   can figure it out yourself.  And you don't want to pool risk, because the younger you are, the more risk you should take.<br><br><b>A Public Service Message</b><br><br>I'd like to conclude with a joint message from me and your parents. Don't drop out of college to start a startup.  There's no rush.      There will be plenty of time to start companies after you graduate. In fact, it may be just as well to go work for an existing company for a couple years after you graduate, to learn how companies work.<br><br>And yet, when I think about it, I can't imagine telling Bill Gates at 19 that he should wait till he graduated to start a company.     He'd have told me to get lost.  And could I have honestly claimed that he was harming his future-- that he was learning less by working at ground zero of the microcomputer revolution than he would have if he'd been taking classes back at Harvard?  No, probably not.<br><br>And yes, while it is probably true that you'll learn some valuable things by going to work for an existing company for a couple years before starting your own, you'd learn a thing or two running your   own company during that time too.<br><br>The advice about going to work for someone else would get an even colder reception from the 19 year old Bill Gates.  So I'm supposed  to finish college, then go work for another company for two years, and then I can start my own?  I have to wait till I'm 23?  That's   <i>four years</i>.  That's more than twenty percent of my life so far.  Plus in four years it will be way too late to make money      writing a Basic interpreter for the Altair.<br><br>And he'd be right.  The Apple II was launched just two years later. In fact, if Bill had finished college and gone to work for another company as we're suggesting, he might well have gone to work for Apple.  And while that would probably have been better for all of us, it wouldn't have been better for him.<br><br>So while I stand by our responsible advice to finish college and then go work for a while before starting a startup, I have to admit it's one of those things the old tell the young, but don't expect them to listen to.  We say this sort of thing mainly so we can claim we warned you.  So don't say I didn't warn you.<br><br><br><br> <b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] The average B-17 pilot in World War II was in his early twenties.

Ten years ago there seemed a real danger Microsoft would extend its monopoly to servers.  It seems safe to say now that open source has prevented that.  A recent survey found 52% of companies are replacing Windows servers with Linux servers. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>More significant, I think, is <i>which</i> 52% they are.  At this point, anyone proposing to run Windows on servers should be prepared to explain what they know about servers that Google, Yahoo, and Amazon don't.<br><br>But the biggest thing business has to learn from open source is not about Linux or Firefox, but about the forces that produced them. Ultimately these will affect a lot more than what software you use.<br><br>We may be able to get a fix on these underlying forces by triangulating from open source and blogging.  As you've probably noticed, they have a lot in common.<br><br>Like open source, blogging is something people do themselves, for free, because they enjoy it.  Like open source hackers, bloggers compete with people working for money, and often win.  The method of ensuring quality is also the same: Darwinian.  Companies ensure quality through rules to prevent employees from screwing up.  But you don't need that when the audience can communicate with one another.  People just produce whatever they want; the good stuff spreads, and the bad gets ignored.  And in both cases, feedback from the audience improves the best work.<br><br>Another thing blogging and open source have in common is the Web. People have always been willing to do great work for free,  but before the Web it was harder to reach an audience or collaborate on projects.<br><br><b>Amateurs</b><br><br>I think the most important of the new principles business has to learn is that people work a lot harder on stuff they like.  Well, that's news to no one.  So how can I claim business has to learn it?  When I say business doesn't know this, I mean the structure of business doesn't reflect it.<br><br>Business still reflects an older model, exemplified by the French word for working: <i>travailler</i>.  It has an English cousin, travail, and what it means is torture. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>This turns out not to be the last word on work, however. As societies get richer, they learn something about work that's a lot like what they learn about diet.  We know now that the healthiest diet is the one our peasant ancestors were forced to eat because they were poor.  Like rich food, idleness only seems desirable when you don't get enough of it.  I think we were designed to work, just as we were designed to eat a certain amount of fiber, and we feel bad if we don't.<br><br>There's a name for people who work for the love of it: amateurs. The word now has such bad connotations that we forget its etymology, though it's staring us in the face.  "Amateur" was originally rather a complimentary word.  But the thing to be in the twentieth century was professional, which amateurs, by definition, are not.<br><br>That's why the business world was so surprised by one lesson from open source: that people working for love often surpass those working for money.   Users don't switch from Explorer to Firefox because they want to hack the source.  They switch because it's a better browser.<br><br>It's not that Microsoft isn't trying.  They know controlling the browser is one of the keys to retaining their monopoly.  The problem is the same they face in operating systems: they can't pay people enough to build something better than a group of inspired hackers will build for free.<br><br>I suspect professionalism was always overrated-- not just in the literal sense of working for money, but also connotations like formality and detachment.  Inconceivable as it would have seemed in, say, 1970, I think professionalism was largely a fashion, driven by conditions that happened to exist in the twentieth century.<br><br>One of the most powerful of those was the existence of "channels." Revealingly, the same term was used for both products and information:  there were distribution channels, and TV and radio channels.<br><br>It was the narrowness of such channels that made professionals seem so superior to amateurs.  There were only a few jobs as professional journalists, for example, so competition ensured the average journalist was fairly good.  Whereas anyone can express opinions about current events in a bar.  And so the average person expressing his opinions in a bar sounds like an idiot compared to a journalist writing about the subject.<br><br>On the Web, the barrier for publishing your ideas is even lower. You don't have to buy a drink, and they even let kids in. Millions of people are publishing online, and the average level of what they're writing, as you might expect, is not very good.  This has led some in the media to conclude that blogs don't present much of a threat-- that blogs are just a fad.<br><br>Actually, the fad is the word "blog,"  at least the way the print media now use it.  What they mean by "blogger" is not someone who publishes in a weblog format, but anyone who publishes online. That's going to become a problem as the Web becomes the default medium for publication.  So I'd like to suggest an alternative word for someone who publishes online. How about "writer?"<br><br>Those in the print media who dismiss the writing online because of its low average quality are missing an important point: no one reads the <i>average</i> blog.  In the old world of channels, it meant something to talk about average quality, because that's what you were getting whether you liked it or not. But now you can read any writer you want.  So the average quality of writing online isn't what the print media are competing against.  They're competing against the best writing online.  And,  like Microsoft, they're losing.<br><br>I know that from my own experience as a reader.  Though most print publications are online, I probably read two or three articles on individual people's sites for every one I read on the site of a newspaper or magazine.<br><br>And when I read, say, New York Times stories, I never reach them through the Times front page.   Most I find through aggregators like Google News or Slashdot or Delicious. Aggregators show how much <a href="http://reddit.com">better</a>  you can do than the channel.  The New York Times front page is a list of articles written by people who work for the New York Times.  Delicious is a list of articles that are interesting.  And it's only now that you can see the two side by side that you notice how little overlap there is.<br><br>Most articles in the print media are boring.  For example, the president notices that a majority of voters now think invading Iraq was a mistake, so he makes an address to the nation to drum up support.  Where is the man bites dog in that?  I didn't hear the speech, but I could probably tell you exactly what he said.  A speech like that is, in the most literal sense, not news: there is nothing <i>new</i> in it. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Nor is there anything new, except the names and places, in most "news" about things going wrong.  A child is abducted; there's a tornado; a ferry sinks; someone gets bitten by a shark; a small plane crashes.  And what do you learn about the world from these stories?  Absolutely nothing.  They're outlying data points; what makes them gripping also makes them irrelevant.<br><br>As in software, when professionals produce such crap, it's not surprising if amateurs can do better.  Live by the channel, die by the channel: if you depend on an oligopoly, you sink into bad habits that are hard to overcome when you suddenly get competition. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br><b>Workplaces</b><br><br>Another thing blogs and open source software have in common is that they're often made by people working at home.  That may not seem surprising.  But it should be.  It's the architectural equivalent of a home-made aircraft shooting down an F-18.  Companies spend millions to build office buildings for a single purpose: to be a place to work.  And yet people working in their own homes, which aren't even designed to be workplaces, end up being more productive.<br><br>This proves something a lot of us have suspected.  The average office is a miserable place to get work done.  And a lot of what makes offices bad are the very qualities we associate with professionalism.  The sterility of offices is supposed to suggest efficiency.  But suggesting efficiency is a different thing from actually being efficient.<br><br>The atmosphere of the average workplace is to productivity what flames painted on the side of a car are to speed.  And it's not just the way offices look that's bleak.  The way people act is just as bad.<br><br>Things are different in a startup.  Often as not a startup begins in an apartment.  Instead of matching beige cubicles they have an assortment of furniture they bought used.  They work odd hours, wearing the most casual of clothing.  They look at whatever they want online without worrying whether it's "work safe." The cheery, bland language of the office is replaced by wicked humor.  And you know what?  The company at this stage is probably the most productive it's ever going to be.<br><br>Maybe it's not a coincidence.  Maybe some aspects of professionalism are actually a net lose.<br><br>To me the most demoralizing aspect of the traditional office is that you're supposed to be there at certain times.  There are usually a few people in a company who really have to, but the reason most employees work fixed hours is that the company can't measure their productivity.<br><br>The basic idea behind office hours is that if you can't make people work, you can at least prevent them from having fun.  If employees have to be in the building a certain number of hours a day, and are forbidden to do non-work things while there, then they must be working.  In theory.  In practice they spend a lot of their time in a no-man's land, where they're neither working nor having fun.<br><br>If you could measure how much work people did, many companies wouldn't need any fixed workday. You could just say: this is what you have to do.  Do it whenever you like, wherever you like.  If your work requires you to talk to other people in the company, then you may need to be here a certain amount.  Otherwise we don't care.<br><br>That may seem utopian, but it's what we told people who came to work for our company.  There were no fixed office hours.  I never showed up before 11 in the morning.  But we weren't saying this to be benevolent.  We were saying: if you work here we expect you to get a lot done.  Don't try to fool us just by being here a lot.<br><br>The problem with the facetime model is not just that it's demoralizing, but that the people pretending to work interrupt the ones actually working.  I'm convinced the facetime model is the main reason large organizations have so many meetings. Per capita, large organizations accomplish very little. And yet all those people have to be on site at least eight hours a day.  When so much time goes in one end and so little achievement comes out the other, something has to give.  And meetings are the main mechanism for taking up the slack.<br><br>For one year I worked at a regular nine to five job, and I remember well the strange, cozy feeling that comes over one during meetings. I was very aware, because of the novelty, that I was being paid for programming.  It seemed just amazing, as if there was a machine on my desk that spat out a dollar bill every two minutes no matter what I did.  Even while I was in the bathroom!  But because the imaginary machine was always running, I felt I always ought to be working. And so meetings felt wonderfully relaxing.  They counted as work, just like programming, but they were so much easier. All you had to do was sit and look attentive.<br><br>Meetings are like an opiate with a network effect.  So is email, on a smaller scale.  And in addition to the direct cost in time, there's the cost in fragmentation-- breaking people's day up into bits too small to be useful.<br><br>You can see how dependent you've become on something by removing it suddenly.  So for big companies I propose the following experiment. Set aside one day where meetings are forbidden-- where everyone has to sit at their desk all day and work without interruption on things they can do without talking to anyone else. Some amount of communication is necessary in most jobs, but I'm sure many employees could find eight hours worth of stuff they could do by themselves.  You could call it "Work Day."<br><br>The other problem with pretend work is that it often looks better than real work.  When I'm writing or hacking I spend as much time just thinking as I do actually typing.  Half the time I'm sitting drinking a cup of tea, or walking around the neighborhood.  This is a critical phase-- this is where ideas come from-- and yet I'd feel guilty doing this in most offices, with everyone else looking busy.<br><br>It's hard to see how bad some practice is till you have something to compare it to.  And that's one reason open source, and even blogging in some cases, are so important.  They show us what real work looks like.<br><br>We're funding eight new startups at the moment.  A friend asked what they were doing for office space, and seemed surprised when I said we expected them to work out of whatever apartments they found to live in.  But we didn't propose that to save money.  We did it because we want their software to be good.  Working in crappy informal spaces is one of the things startups do right without realizing it.  As soon as you get into an office, work and life start to drift apart.<br><br>That is one of the key tenets of professionalism. Work and life are supposed to be separate.  But that part, I'm convinced, is a  mistake.<br><br><b>Bottom-Up</b><br><br>The third big lesson we can learn from open source and blogging is that ideas can bubble up from the bottom, instead of flowing down from the top.  Open source and blogging both work bottom-up: people make what they want, and the best stuff prevails.<br><br>Does this sound familiar?  It's the principle of a market economy. Ironically, though open source and blogs are done for free, those worlds resemble market economies, while most companies, for all their talk about the value of free markets, are run internally like communist states.<br><br>There are two forces that together steer design: ideas about what to do next, and the enforcement of quality.  In the channel era, both flowed down from the top.  For example, newspaper editors assigned stories to reporters, then edited what they wrote.<br><br>Open source and blogging show us things don't have to work that way.  Ideas and even the enforcement of quality can flow bottom-up. And in both cases the results are not merely acceptable, but better. For example, open source software is more reliable precisely because it's open source; anyone can find mistakes.<br><br>The same happens with writing.  As we got close to publication, I found I was very worried about the essays in  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596006624">Hackers &amp; Painters</a> that hadn't been online.  Once an essay has had a couple thousand page views I feel reasonably confident about it.  But these had had  literally orders of magnitude less scrutiny.  It felt like releasing software without testing it.<br><br>That's what all publishing used to be like.  If you got ten people to read a manuscript, you were lucky.  But I'd become so used to publishing online that the old method now seemed alarmingly unreliable, like navigating by dead reckoning once you'd gotten used to a GPS.<br><br>The other thing I like about publishing online is that you can write what you want and publish when you want.  Earlier this year I wrote <a href="inequality.html">something</a> that seemed suitable for a magazine, so I sent it to an editor I know. As I was waiting to hear back, I found to my surprise that I was hoping they'd reject it.  Then I could put it online right away. If they accepted it, it wouldn't be read by anyone for months, and in the meantime I'd have to fight word-by-word to save it from being mangled by some twenty five year old copy editor. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>Many employees would <i>like</i> to build great things for the companies they work for, but more often than not management won't let them. How many of us have heard stories of employees going to management and saying, please let us build this thing to make money for you-- and the company saying no?  The most famous example is probably Steve Wozniak, who originally wanted to build microcomputers for his then-employer, HP. And they turned him down.  On the blunderometer, this episode ranks with IBM accepting a non-exclusive license for DOS.  But I think this happens all the time.  We just don't hear about it usually, because to prove yourself right you have to quit and start your own company, like Wozniak did.<br><br><b>Startups</b><br><br>So these, I think, are the three big lessons open source and blogging have to teach business: (1) that people work harder on stuff they like, (2) that the standard office environment is very unproductive, and (3) that bottom-up often works better than top-down.<br><br>I can imagine managers at this point saying: what is this guy talking about?  What good does it do me to know that my programmers would be more productive working at home on their own projects?  I need their asses in here working on version 3.2 of our software, or we're never going to make the release date.<br><br>And it's true, the benefit that specific manager could derive from the forces I've described is near zero.  When I say business can learn from open source, I don't mean any specific business can.  I mean business can learn about new conditions the same way a gene pool does.  I'm not claiming companies can get smarter, just that dumb ones will die.<br><br>So what will business look like when it has assimilated the lessons of open source and blogging?  I think the big obstacle preventing us from seeing the future of business is the assumption that people working for you have to be employees.  But think about what's going on underneath:  the company has some money, and they pay it to the employee in the hope that he'll make something worth more than they paid him.  Well, there are other ways to arrange that relationship. Instead of paying the guy money as a salary, why not give it to him as investment?  Then instead of coming to your office to work on your projects, he can work wherever he wants on projects of his own.<br><br>Because few of us know any alternative, we have no idea how much better we could do than the traditional employer-employee relationship. Such customs evolve with glacial slowness.  Our  employer-employee relationship still retains a big chunk of master-servant DNA. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font><br><br>I dislike being on either end of it. I'll work my ass off for a customer, but I resent being told what to do by a boss.  And being a boss is also horribly frustrating;  half the time it's easier just to do stuff yourself than to get someone else to do it for you. I'd rather do almost anything than give or receive a performance review.<br><br>On top of its unpromising origins, employment has accumulated a lot of cruft over the years.  The list of what you can't ask in job interviews is now so long that for convenience I assume it's infinite.  Within the office you now have to walk on eggshells lest anyone  <a href="say.html">say</a> or do something that makes the company prey to a lawsuit.  And God help you if you fire anyone.<br><br>Nothing shows more clearly that employment is not an ordinary economic relationship than companies being sued for firing people.  In any purely economic relationship you're free to do what you want.  If you want to stop buying steel pipe from one supplier and start buying it from another, you don't have to explain why.  No one can accuse you of <i>unjustly</i> switching pipe suppliers.  Justice implies some kind of paternal obligation that isn't there in transactions between equals.<br><br>Most of the legal restrictions on employers are intended to protect employees.  But you can't have action without an equal and opposite reaction.  You can't expect employers to have some kind of paternal responsibility toward employees without putting employees in the position of children.  And that seems a bad road to go down.<br><br>Next time you're in a moderately large city, drop by the main post office and watch the body language of the people working there. They have the same sullen resentment as children made to do something they don't want to.  Their union has exacted pay increases and work restrictions that would have been the envy of previous generations of postal workers, and yet they don't seem any happier for it.  It's demoralizing to be on the receiving end of a paternalistic relationship, no matter how cozy the terms.  Just ask any teenager.<br><br>I see the disadvantages of the employer-employee relationship because I've been on both sides of a better one: the investor-founder relationship. I wouldn't claim it's painless.  When I was running a startup, the thought of our investors used to keep me up at night. And now that I'm an <a href="http://ycombinator.com">investor</a>, the thought of our startups keeps me up at night.  All the pain of whatever problem you're trying to solve is still there. But the pain hurts less when it isn't mixed with resentment.<br><br>I had the misfortune to participate in what amounted to a controlled experiment to prove that.  After Yahoo bought our startup I went to work for them.  I was doing exactly the same work, except with bosses.  And to my horror I started acting like a child.  The  situation pushed buttons I'd forgotten I had.<br><br>The big advantage of investment over employment, as the examples of open source and blogging suggest, is that people working on projects of their own are enormously more productive.  And a <a href="start.html">startup</a> is a project of one's own in two senses, both of them important: it's creatively one's own, and also economically ones's own.<br><br>Google is a rare example of a big company in tune with the forces I've described. They've tried hard to make their offices less sterile than the usual cube farm.  They give employees who do great work large grants of stock to simulate the rewards of a startup.  They even let hackers spend 20% of their time on their own projects.<br><br>Why not let people spend 100% of their time on their own projects, and instead of trying to approximate the value of what they create, give them the actual market value?  Impossible?  That is in fact what venture capitalists do.<br><br>So am I claiming that no one is going to be an employee anymore-- that everyone should go and start a startup?  Of course not. But more people could do it than do it now. At the moment, even the smartest students leave school thinking they have to get a <a href="hiring.html">job</a>.   Actually what they need to do is make something valuable.  A job is one way to do that, but the more ambitious ones will ordinarily be better off taking money from an investor than an employer.<br><br>Hackers tend to think business is for MBAs.  But business administration is not what you're doing in a startup.  What you're doing is business <i>creation</i>.  And the first phase of that is mostly product creation-- that is, hacking.  That's the hard part.  It's a lot harder to create something people love than to take something people love and figure out how to make money from it.<br><br>Another thing that keeps people away from starting startups is the risk.  Someone with kids and a mortgage should think twice before doing it.  But most young hackers have neither.<br><br>And as the example of open source and blogging suggests, you'll enjoy it more, even if you fail.  You'll be working on your own thing, instead of going to some office and doing what you're told. There may be more pain in your own company, but it won't hurt as much.<br><br>That may be the greatest effect, in the long run, of the forces  underlying open source and blogging: finally ditching the old paternalistic employer-employee relationship, and replacing it with a purely economic one, between equals.<br><br><br><br> <b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] Survey by Forrester Research reported in the cover story of Business Week, 31 Jan 2005.

Our first batch, in the summer of 2005, had eight startups in it.  Of those eight, it now looks as if at least four succeeded.  Three have been acquired:  <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> was a merger of two, Reddit and Infogami, and a third was acquired that we can't talk about yet.  Another from that batch was  <a href="http://loopt.com">Loopt</a>, which is doing so well they could probably be acquired in about ten minutes if they wanted to.<br><br>So about half the founders from that first summer, less than two years ago, are now rich, at least by their standards.  (One thing you learn when you get rich is that there are many degrees of it.)<br><br>I'm not ready to predict our success rate will stay as high as 50%. That first batch could have been an anomaly.  But we should be able to do better than the oft-quoted (and probably made up) standard figure of 10%.  I'd feel safe aiming at 25%.<br><br>Even the founders who fail don't seem to have such a bad time.  Of those first eight startups, three are now probably dead.  In two cases the founders just went on to do other things at the end of the summer.   I don't think they were traumatized by the experience. The closest to a traumatic failure was Kiko, whose founders kept working on their startup for a whole year before being squashed by Google Calendar.  But they ended up happy.  They sold their software on eBay for a quarter of a million dollars.  After they paid back their angel investors, they had about a year's salary each.   <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font> Then they immediately went on to start a new and much more exciting startup, <a href="http://justin.tv">Justin.TV</a>.<br><br>So here is an even more striking statistic: 0% of that first batch had a terrible experience.  They had ups and downs, like every startup, but I don't think any would have traded it for a job in a cubicle.  And that statistic is probably not an anomaly.  Whatever our long-term success rate ends up being, I think the rate of people who wish they'd gotten a regular job will stay close to 0%.<br><br>The big mystery to me is: why don't more people start startups?  If nearly everyone who does it prefers it to a regular job, and a significant percentage get rich, why doesn't everyone want to do this?  A lot of people think we get thousands of applications for each funding cycle.  In fact we usually only get several hundred. Why don't more people apply?  And while it must seem to anyone watching this world that startups are popping up like crazy, the number is small compared to the number of people with the necessary skills.  The great majority of programmers still go straight from college to cubicle, and stay there.<br><br>It seems like people are not acting in their own interest.  What's going on?   Well, I can answer that.  Because of Y Combinator's position at the very start of the venture funding process, we're probably the world's leading experts on the psychology of people who aren't sure if they want to start a company.<br><br>There's nothing wrong with being unsure.  If you're a hacker thinking about starting a startup and hesitating before taking the leap, you're part of a grand tradition.  Larry and Sergey seem to have felt the same before they started Google, and so did Jerry and Filo before they started Yahoo.  In fact, I'd guess the most successful startups are the ones started by uncertain hackers rather than gung-ho business guys.<br><br>We have some evidence to support this.  Several of the most successful startups we've funded told us later that they only decided to apply at the last moment.  Some decided only hours before the deadline.<br><br>The way to deal with uncertainty is to analyze it into components. Most people who are reluctant to do something have about eight different reasons mixed together in their heads, and don't know themselves which are biggest.  Some will be justified and some bogus, but unless you know the relative proportion of each, you don't know whether your overall uncertainty is mostly justified or mostly bogus.<br><br>So I'm going to list all the components of people's reluctance to start startups, and explain which are real.  Then would-be founders can use this as a checklist to examine their own feelings.<br><br>I admit my goal is to increase your self-confidence.  But there are two things different here from the usual confidence-building exercise. One is that I'm motivated to be honest.  Most people in the confidence-building business have already achieved their goal when you buy the book or pay to attend the seminar where they tell you how great you are.  Whereas if I encourage people to start startups who shouldn't, I make my own life worse.  If I encourage too many people to apply to Y Combinator, it just means more work for me, because I have to read all the applications.<br><br>The other thing that's going to be different is my approach.  Instead of being positive, I'm going to be negative.  Instead of telling you "come on, you can do it" I'm going to consider all the reasons you aren't doing it, and show why most (but not all) should be ignored.  We'll start with the one everyone's born with.<br><br><b>1. Too young</b><br><br>A lot of people think they're too young to start a startup.  Many are right.  The median age worldwide is about 27, so probably a third of the population can truthfully say they're too young.<br><br>What's too young?  One of our goals with Y Combinator was to discover the lower bound on the age of startup founders.  It always seemed to us that investors were too conservative here&mdash;that they wanted to fund professors, when really they should be funding grad students or even undergrads.<br><br>The main thing we've discovered from pushing the edge of this envelope is not where the edge is, but how fuzzy it is.  The outer limit may be as low as 16.  We don't look beyond 18 because people younger than that can't legally enter into contracts.  But the most successful founder we've funded so far, Sam Altman, was 19 at the time.<br><br>Sam Altman, however, is an outlying data point.  When he was 19, he seemed like he had a 40 year old inside him.  There are other 19 year olds who are 12 inside.<br><br>There's a reason we have a distinct word "adult" for people over a certain age.  There is a threshold you cross.  It's conventionally fixed at 21, but different people cross it at greatly varying ages. You're old enough to start a startup if you've crossed this threshold, whatever your age.<br><br>How do you tell?  There are a couple tests adults use.  I realized these tests existed after meeting Sam Altman, actually.  I noticed that I felt like I was talking to someone much older.  Afterward I wondered, what am I even measuring?  What made him seem older?<br><br>One test adults use is whether you still have the kid flake reflex. When you're a little kid and you're asked to do something hard, you can cry and say "I can't do it" and the adults will probably let you off.  As a kid there's a magic button you can press by saying "I'm just a kid" that will get you out of most difficult situations. Whereas adults, by definition, are not allowed to flake.  They still do, of course, but when they do they're ruthlessly pruned.<br><br>The other way to tell an adult is by how they react to a challenge. Someone who's not yet an adult will tend to respond to a challenge from an adult in a way that acknowledges their dominance.  If an adult says "that's a stupid idea," a kid will either crawl away with his tail between his legs, or rebel.  But rebelling presumes inferiority as much as submission.  The adult response to "that's a stupid idea," is simply to look the other person in the eye and say "Really?  Why do you think so?"<br><br>There are a lot of adults who still react childishly to challenges, of course.  What you don't often find are kids who react to challenges like adults.  When you do, you've found an adult, whatever their age.<br><br><b>2. Too inexperienced</b><br><br>I once wrote that startup founders should be at least 23, and that people should work for another company for a few years before starting their own.  I no longer believe that, and what changed my mind is the example of the startups we've funded.<br><br>I still think 23 is a better age than 21.  But the best way to get experience if you're 21 is to start a startup.  So, paradoxically, if you're too inexperienced to start a startup, what you should do is start one.  That's a way more efficient cure for inexperience than a normal job.  In fact, getting a normal job may actually make you less able to start a startup, by turning you into a tame animal who thinks he needs an office to work in and a product manager to tell him what software to write.<br><br>What really convinced me of this was the Kikos.  They started a startup right out of college.  Their inexperience caused them to make a lot of mistakes.  But by the time we funded their second startup, a year later, they had become extremely formidable.  They were certainly not tame animals.  And there is no way they'd have grown so much if they'd spent that year working at Microsoft, or even Google.  They'd still have been diffident junior programmers.<br><br>So now I'd advise people to go ahead and start startups right out of college.  There's no better time to take risks than when you're young.  Sure, you'll probably fail.  But even failure will get you to the ultimate goal faster than getting a job.<br><br>It worries me a bit to be saying this, because in effect we're advising people to educate themselves by failing at our expense, but it's the truth.<br><br><b>3. Not determined enough</b><br><br>You need a lot of determination to succeed as a startup founder. It's probably the single best predictor of success.<br><br>Some people may not be determined enough to make it.  It's hard for me to say for sure, because I'm so determined that I can't imagine what's going on in the heads of people who aren't.  But I know they exist.<br><br>Most hackers probably underestimate their determination.  I've seen a lot become visibly more determined as they get used to running a  startup.  I can think of several we've funded who would have been delighted at first to be bought for $2 million, but are now set on world domination.<br><br>How can you tell if you're determined enough, when Larry and Sergey themselves were unsure at first about starting a company?  I'm guessing here, but I'd say the test is whether you're sufficiently driven to work on your own projects.  Though they may have been unsure whether they wanted to start a company, it doesn't seem as if Larry and Sergey were meek little research assistants, obediently doing their advisors' bidding.  They started projects of their own.<br><br> <b>4. Not smart enough</b><br><br>You may need to be moderately smart to succeed as a startup founder. But if you're worried about this, you're probably mistaken.  If you're smart enough to worry that you might not be smart enough to start a startup, you probably are.<br><br>And in any case, starting a startup just doesn't require that much intelligence.  Some startups do.  You have to be good at math to write Mathematica.  But most companies do more mundane stuff where the decisive factor is effort, not brains.  Silicon Valley can warp your perspective on this, because there's a cult of smartness here. People who aren't smart at least try to act that way.  But if you think it takes a lot of intelligence to get rich, try spending a couple days in some of the fancier bits of New York or LA.<br><br>If you don't think you're smart enough to start a startup doing something technically difficult, just write enterprise software. Enterprise software companies aren't technology companies, they're sales companies, and sales depends mostly on effort.<br><br><b>5. Know nothing about business</b><br><br>This is another variable whose coefficient should be zero.  You don't need to know anything about business to start a startup.  The initial focus should be the product.  All you need to know in this phase is how to build things people want.  If you succeed, you'll have to think about how to make money from it.  But this is so easy you can pick it up on the fly.<br><br>I get a fair amount of flak for telling founders just to make something great and not worry too much about making money.  And yet all the empirical evidence points that way: pretty much 100% of startups that make something popular manage to make money from it. And acquirers tell me privately that revenue is not what they buy startups for, but their strategic value.  Which means, because they made something people want.  Acquirers know the rule holds for them too: if users love you, you can always make money from that somehow, and if they don't, the cleverest business model in the world won't save you.<br><br>So why do so many people argue with me?  I think one reason is that they hate the idea that a bunch of twenty year olds could get rich from building something cool that doesn't make any money.  They just don't want that to be possible.  But how possible it is doesn't depend on how much they want it to be.<br><br>For a while it annoyed me to hear myself described as some kind of irresponsible pied piper, leading impressionable young hackers down the road to ruin.  But now I realize this kind of controversy is a sign of a good idea.<br><br>The most valuable truths are the ones most people don't believe. They're like undervalued stocks.  If you start with them, you'll have the whole field to yourself.  So when you find an idea you know is good but most people disagree with, you should not merely ignore their objections, but push aggressively in that direction.  In this case, that means you should seek out ideas that would be popular but seem hard to make money from.<br><br>We'll bet a seed round you can't make something popular that we can't figure out how to make money from.<br><br><b>6. No cofounder</b><br><br>Not having a cofounder is a real problem.  A startup is too much for one person to bear.  And though we differ from other investors on a lot of questions, we all agree on this.  All investors, without exception, are more likely to fund you with a cofounder than without.<br><br>We've funded two single founders, but in both cases we suggested their first priority should be to find a cofounder.  Both did.  But we'd have preferred them to have cofounders before they applied. It's not super hard to get a cofounder for a project that's just been funded, and we'd rather have cofounders committed enough to sign up for something super hard.<br><br>If you don't have a cofounder, what should you do?  Get one.  It's more important than anything else.  If there's no one where you live who wants to start a startup with you, move where there are people who do.  If no one wants to work with you on your current idea, switch to an idea people want to work on.<br><br>If you're still in school, you're surrounded by potential cofounders. A few years out it gets harder to find them.  Not only do you have a smaller pool to draw from, but most already have jobs, and perhaps even families to support.  So if you had friends in college you used to scheme about startups with, stay in touch with them as well as you can.  That may help keep the dream alive.<br><br>It's possible you could meet a cofounder through something like a user's group or a conference.  But I wouldn't be too optimistic. You need to work with someone to know whether you want them as a cofounder.   <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>The real lesson to draw from this is not how to find a cofounder, but that you should start startups when you're young and there are lots of them around.<br><br><b>7. No idea</b><br><br>In a sense, it's not a problem if you don't have a good idea, because most startups change their idea anyway.  In the average Y Combinator startup, I'd guess 70% of the idea is new at the end of the first three months.  Sometimes it's 100%.<br><br>In fact, we're so sure the founders are more important than the initial idea that we're going to try something new this funding cycle. We're going to let people apply with no idea at all.  If you want, you can answer the question on the application form that asks what you're going to do with "We have no idea."  If you seem really good we'll accept you anyway.  We're confident we can sit down with you and cook up some promising project.<br><br>Really this just codifies what we do already.  We put little weight on the idea.  We ask mainly out of politeness.  The kind of question on the application form that we really care about is the one where we ask what cool things you've made.  If what you've made is version one of a promising startup, so much the better, but the main thing we care about is whether you're good at making things.  Being lead developer of a popular open source project counts almost as much.<br><br>That solves the problem if you get funded by Y Combinator.  What about in the general case?  Because in another sense, it is a problem if you don't have an idea.  If you start a startup with no idea, what do you do next?<br><br>So here's the brief recipe for getting startup ideas.  Find something that's missing in your own life, and supply that need&mdash;no matter how specific to you it seems.  Steve Wozniak built himself a computer; who knew so many other people would want them?  A need that's narrow but genuine is a better starting point than one that's broad but hypothetical.  So even if the problem is simply that you don't have a date on Saturday night, if you can think of a way to fix that by writing software, you're onto something, because a lot of other people have the same problem.<br><br><b>8. No room for more startups</b><br><br>A lot of people look at the ever-increasing number of startups and think "this can't continue."  Implicit in their thinking is a fallacy: that there is some limit on the number of startups there could be.  But this is false.  No one claims there's any limit on the number of people who can work for salary at 1000-person companies. Why should there be any limit on the number who can work for equity at 5-person companies?  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Nearly everyone who works is satisfying some kind of need.  Breaking up companies into smaller units doesn't make those needs go away. Existing needs would probably get satisfied more efficiently by a network of startups than by a few giant, hierarchical organizations, but I don't think that would mean less opportunity, because satisfying current needs would lead to more.  Certainly this tends to be the case in individuals.  Nor is there anything wrong with that.  We take for granted things that medieval kings would have considered effeminate luxuries, like whole buildings heated to spring temperatures year round.  And if things go well, our descendants will take for granted things we would consider shockingly luxurious.  There is no absolute standard for material wealth.  Health care is a component of it, and that alone is a black hole.  For the foreseeable future, people will want ever more material wealth, so there is no limit to the amount of work available for companies, and for startups in particular.<br><br>Usually the limited-room fallacy is not expressed directly.  Usually it's implicit in statements like "there are only so many startups Google, Microsoft, and Yahoo can buy."  Maybe, though the list of acquirers is a lot longer than that.  And whatever you think of other acquirers, Google is not stupid.  The reason big companies buy startups is that they've created something valuable.  And why should there be any limit to the number of valuable startups companies can acquire, any more than there is a limit to the amount of wealth individual people want?  Maybe there would be practical limits on the number of startups any one acquirer could assimilate, but if there is value to be had, in the form of upside that founders are willing to forgo in return for an immediate payment, acquirers will evolve to consume it.  Markets are pretty smart that way.<br><br><b>9. Family to support</b><br><br>This one is real.  I wouldn't advise anyone with a family to start a startup.  I'm not saying it's a bad idea, just that I don't want to take responsibility for advising it.  I'm willing to take responsibility for telling 22 year olds to start startups.  So what if they fail?  They'll learn a lot, and that job at Microsoft will still be waiting for them if they need it.  But I'm not prepared to cross moms.<br><br>What you can do, if you have a family and want to start a startup, is start a consulting business you can then gradually turn into a product business.  Empirically the chances of pulling that off seem very small. You're never going to produce Google this way.  But at least you'll never be without an income.<br><br>Another way to decrease the risk is to join an existing startup instead of starting your own.  Being one of the first employees of a startup is a lot like being a founder, in both the good ways and the bad.  You'll be roughly 1/n^2 founder, where n is your employee number.<br><br>As with the question of cofounders, the real lesson here is to start startups when you're young.<br><br><b>10. Independently wealthy</b><br><br>This is my excuse for not starting a startup.  Startups are stressful. Why do it if you don't need the money?  For every "serial entrepreneur," there are probably twenty sane ones who think "Start another company?  Are you crazy?"<br><br>I've come close to starting new startups a couple times, but I always pull back because I don't want four years of my life to be consumed by random schleps.  I know this business well enough to know you can't do it half-heartedly.  What makes a good startup founder so dangerous is his willingness to endure infinite schleps.<br><br>There is a bit of a problem with retirement, though.  Like a lot of people, I like to work.  And one of the many weird little problems you discover when you get rich is that a lot of the interesting people you'd like to work with are not rich.  They need to work at something that pays the bills.  Which means if you want to have them as colleagues, you have to work at something that pays the bills too, even though you don't need to.  I think this is what drives a lot of serial entrepreneurs, actually.<br><br>That's why I love working on Y Combinator so much.  It's an excuse to work on something interesting with people I like.<br><br><b>11.  Not ready for commitment</b><br><br>This was my reason for not starting a startup for most of my twenties. Like a lot of people that age, I valued freedom most of all.  I was reluctant to do anything that required a commitment of more than a few months.  Nor would I have wanted to do anything that completely took over my life the way a startup does.  And that's fine.  If you want to spend your time travelling around, or playing in a band, or whatever, that's a perfectly legitimate reason not to start a company.<br><br>If you start a startup that succeeds, it's going to consume at least three or four years.  (If it fails, you'll be done a lot quicker.) So you shouldn't do it if you're not ready for commitments on that scale.  Be aware, though, that if you get a regular job, you'll probably end up working there for as long as a startup would take, and you'll find you have much less spare time than you might expect. So if you're ready to clip on that ID badge and go to that orientation session, you may also be ready to start that startup.<br><br><b>12.  Need for structure</b><br><br>I'm told there are people who need structure in their lives.  This seems to be a nice way of saying they need someone to tell them what to do.  I believe such people exist.  There's plenty of empirical evidence: armies, religious cults, and so on.  They may even be the majority.<br><br>If you're one of these people, you probably shouldn't start a startup.  In fact, you probably shouldn't even go to work for one. In a good startup, you don't get told what to do very much.  There may be one person whose job title is CEO, but till the company has about twelve people no one should be telling anyone what to do. That's too inefficient.  Each person should just do what they need to without anyone telling them.<br><br>If that sounds like a recipe for chaos, think about a soccer team. Eleven people manage to work together in quite complicated ways, and yet only in occasional emergencies does anyone tell anyone else what to do.  A reporter once asked David Beckham if there were any language problems at Real Madrid, since the players were from about eight different countries.  He said it was never an issue, because everyone was so good they never had to talk.  They all just did the right thing.<br><br>How do you tell if you're independent-minded enough to start a startup?  If you'd bristle at the suggestion that you aren't, then you probably are.<br><br><b>13. Fear of uncertainty</b><br><br>Perhaps some people are deterred from starting startups because they don't like the uncertainty.  If you go to work for Microsoft, you can predict fairly accurately what the next few years will be like&mdash;all too accurately, in fact.  If you start a startup, anything might happen.<br><br>Well, if you're troubled by uncertainty, I can solve that problem for you: if you start a startup, it will probably fail.  Seriously,  though, this is not a bad way to think about the whole experience.  Hope for the best, but expect the worst.  In the worst case, it will at least be interesting.  In the best case you might get rich.<br><br>No one will blame you if the startup tanks, so long as you made a serious effort.  There may once have been a time when employers would regard that as a mark against you, but they wouldn't now.  I asked managers at big companies, and they all said they'd prefer to hire someone who'd tried to start a startup and failed over someone who'd spent the same time working at a big company.<br><br>Nor will investors hold it against you, as long as you didn't fail out of laziness or incurable stupidity.   I'm told there's a lot of stigma attached to failing in other places&mdash;in Europe, for example.  Not here.  In America, companies, like practically everything else, are disposable.<br><br><b>14. Don't realize what you're avoiding</b><br><br>One reason people who've been out in the world for a year or two make better founders than people straight from college is that they know what they're avoiding.  If their startup fails, they'll have to get a job, and they know how much jobs suck.<br><br>If you've had summer jobs in college, you may think you know what jobs are like, but you probably don't.  Summer jobs at technology companies are not real jobs.  If you get a summer job as a waiter, that's a real job.  Then you have to carry your weight.  But software companies don't hire students for the summer as a source of cheap labor.  They do it in the hope of recruiting them when they graduate. So while they're happy if you produce, they don't expect you to.<br><br>That will change if you get a real job after you graduate.  Then you'll have to earn your keep.  And since most of what big companies do is boring, you're going to have to work on boring stuff.  Easy, compared to college, but boring.  At first it may seem cool to get paid for doing easy stuff, after paying to do hard stuff in college. But that wears off after a few months.  Eventually it gets demoralizing to work on dumb stuff, even if it's easy and you get paid a lot.<br><br>And that's not the worst of it.  The thing that really sucks about having a regular job is the expectation that you're supposed to be there at certain times.  Even Google is afflicted with this, apparently.  And what this means, as everyone who's had a regular job can tell you, is that there are going to be times when you have absolutely no desire to work on anything, and you're going to have to go to work anyway and sit in front of your screen and pretend to.  To someone who likes work, as most good hackers do, this is torture.<br><br>In a startup, you skip all that.  There's no concept of office hours in most startups.  Work and life just get mixed together.  But the good thing about that is that no one minds if you have a life at work.  In a startup you can do whatever you want most of the time. If you're a founder, what you want to do most of the time is work. But you never have to pretend to.<br><br>If you took a nap in your office in a big company, it would seem unprofessional.  But if you're starting a startup and you fall asleep in the middle of the day, your cofounders will just assume you were tired.<br><br><b>15. Parents want you to be a doctor</b><br><br>A significant number of would-be startup founders are probably dissuaded from doing it by their parents.  I'm not going to say you shouldn't listen to them.  Families are entitled to their own traditions, and who am I to argue with them?  But I will give you a couple reasons why a safe career might not be what your parents really want for you.<br><br>One is that parents tend to be more conservative for their kids than they would be for themselves.  This is actually a rational response to their situation.  Parents end up sharing more of their kids' ill fortune than good fortune.  Most parents don't mind this; it's part of the job; but it does tend to make them excessively conservative.  And erring on the side of conservatism is still erring.  In almost everything, reward is proportionate to risk.  So by protecting their kids from risk, parents are, without realizing it, also protecting them from rewards.  If they saw that, they'd want you to take more risks.<br><br>The other reason parents may be mistaken is that, like generals, they're always fighting the last war.  If they want you to be a doctor, odds are it's not just because they want you to help the sick, but also because it's a prestigious and lucrative career. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font> But not so lucrative or prestigious as it was when their opinions were formed.  When I was a kid in the seventies, a doctor was <i>the</i> thing to be.  There was a sort of golden triangle involving doctors, Mercedes 450SLs, and tennis.  All three vertices now seem pretty dated.<br><br>The parents who want you to be a doctor may simply not realize how much things have changed.  Would they be that unhappy if you were Steve Jobs instead?  So I think the way to deal with your parents' opinions about what you should do is to treat them like feature requests.  Even if your only goal is to please them, the way to do that is not simply to give them what they ask for.  Instead think about why they're asking for something, and see if there's a better way to give them what they need.<br><br><b>16.  A job is the default</b><br><br>This leads us to the last and probably most powerful reason people get regular jobs: it's the default thing to do.  Defaults are enormously powerful, precisely because they operate without any conscious choice.<br><br>To almost everyone except criminals, it seems an axiom that if you need money, you should get a job.  Actually this tradition is not much more than a hundred years old.  Before that, the default way to make a living was by farming.  It's a bad plan to treat something only a hundred years old as an axiom.  By historical standards, that's something that's changing pretty rapidly.<br><br>We may be seeing another such change right now.  I've read a lot of economic history, and I understand the startup world pretty well, and it now seems to me fairly likely that we're seeing the beginning of a change like the one from farming to manufacturing.<br><br>And you know what?  If you'd been around when that change began (around 1000 in Europe) it would have seemed to nearly everyone that running off to the city to make your fortune was a crazy thing to do.  Though serfs were in principle forbidden to leave their manors, it can't have been that hard to run away to a city.  There were no guards patrolling the perimeter of the village.  What prevented most serfs from leaving was that it seemed insanely risky. Leave one's plot of land?  Leave the people you'd spent your whole life with, to live in a giant city of three or four thousand complete strangers?  How would you live?  How would you get food, if you didn't grow it?<br><br>Frightening as it seemed to them, it's now the default with us to live by our wits.  So if it seems risky to you to start a startup, think how risky it once seemed to your ancestors to live as we do now.  Oddly enough, the people who know this best are the very ones trying to get you to stick to the old model.  How can Larry and Sergey say you should come work as their employee, when they didn't get jobs themselves?<br><br>Now we look back on medieval peasants and wonder how they stood it. How grim it must have been to till the same fields your whole life with no hope of anything better, under the thumb of lords and priests you had to give all your surplus to and acknowledge as your masters. I wouldn't be surprised if one day people look back on what we consider a normal job in the same way.  How grim it would be to commute every day to a cubicle in some soulless office complex, and be told what to do by someone you had to acknowledge as a boss&mdash;someone  who could call you into their office and say "take a seat," and you'd sit!  Imagine having to ask <i>permission</i> to release software to users.  Imagine being sad on Sunday afternoons because the weekend was almost over, and tomorrow you'd have to get up and go to work.  How did they stand it?<br><br>It's exciting to think we may be on the cusp of another shift like the one from farming to manufacturing.  That's why I care about startups.  Startups aren't interesting just because they're a way to make a lot of money.  I couldn't care less about other ways to do that, like speculating in securities.  At most those are interesting the way puzzles are.  There's more going on with startups.  They may represent one of those rare, historic shifts in the way  <a href="wealth.html">wealth</a> is created.<br><br>That's ultimately what drives us to work on Y Combinator.  We want to make money, if only so we don't have to stop doing it, but that's not the main goal.  There have only been a handful of these great economic shifts in human history.  It would be an amazing hack to make one happen faster.<br><br><br><br> <b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] The only people who lost were us.

After standing there gaping for a few seconds I realized this was kind of a trick question.  It's equivalent to asking how to make a startup succeed&mdash;if you avoid every cause of failure, you succeed&mdash;and that's too big a question to answer on the fly.<br><br>Afterwards I realized it could be helpful to look at the problem from this direction.  If you have a list of all the things you shouldn't do, you can turn that into a recipe for succeeding just by negating.  And this form of list may be more useful in practice. It's easier to catch yourself doing something you shouldn't than always to remember to do something you should. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>In a sense there's just one mistake that kills startups: not making something users want.  If you make something users want, you'll probably be fine, whatever else you do or don't do.  And if you don't make something users want, then you're dead, whatever else you do or don't do.  So really this is a list of 18 things that cause startups not to make something users want.  Nearly all failure funnels through that.<br><br><b>1. Single Founder</b><br><br>Have you ever noticed how few successful startups were founded by just one person?  Even companies you think of as having one founder, like Oracle, usually turn out to have more.  It seems unlikely this is a coincidence.<br><br>What's wrong with having one founder?  To start with, it's a vote of no confidence.  It probably means the founder couldn't talk any of his friends into starting the company with him.  That's pretty alarming, because his friends are the ones who know him best.<br><br>But even if the founder's friends were all wrong and the company is a good bet, he's still at a disadvantage.  Starting a startup is too hard for one person.  Even if you could do all the work yourself, you need colleagues to brainstorm with, to talk you out of stupid decisions, and to cheer you up when things go wrong.<br><br>The last one might be the most important.  The low points in a startup are so low that few could bear them alone.  When you have multiple founders, esprit de corps binds them together in a way that seems to violate conservation laws.  Each thinks "I can't let my friends down."  This is one of the most powerful forces in human nature, and it's missing when there's just one founder.<br><br><b>2. Bad Location</b><br><br>Startups prosper in some places and not others.  Silicon Valley dominates, then Boston, then Seattle, Austin, Denver, and New York.  After that there's not much.  Even in New York the number of startups per capita is probably a 20th of what it is in Silicon Valley.  In towns like Houston and Chicago and Detroit it's too small to measure.<br><br>Why is the falloff so sharp?  Probably for the same reason it is in other industries.  What's the sixth largest fashion center in the US?  The sixth largest center for oil, or finance, or publishing? Whatever they are they're probably so far from the top that it would be misleading even to call them centers.<br><br>It's an interesting question why cities  <a href="siliconvalley.html">become</a> startup hubs, but the reason startups prosper in them is probably the same as it is for any industry: that's where the experts are.  Standards are higher; people are more sympathetic to what you're doing; the kind of people you want to hire want to live there; supporting industries are there; the people you run into in chance meetings are in the same business.  Who knows exactly how these factors combine to boost startups in Silicon Valley and squish them in Detroit, but it's clear they do from the number of startups per capita in each.<br><br><b>3. Marginal Niche</b><br><br>Most of the groups that apply to Y Combinator suffer from a common problem: choosing a small, obscure niche in the hope of avoiding competition.<br><br>If you watch little kids playing sports, you notice that below a certain age they're afraid of the ball.  When the ball comes near them their instinct is to avoid it.  I didn't make a lot of catches as an eight year old outfielder, because whenever a fly ball came my way, I used to close my eyes and hold my glove up more for protection than in the hope of catching it.<br><br>Choosing a marginal project is the startup equivalent of my eight year old strategy for dealing with fly balls.  If you make anything good, you're going to have competitors, so you may as well face that.  You can only avoid competition by avoiding good ideas.<br><br>I think this shrinking from big problems is mostly unconscious. It's not that people think of grand ideas but decide to pursue smaller ones because they seem safer.  Your unconscious won't even let you think of grand ideas.  So the solution may be to think about ideas without involving yourself.  What would be a great idea for <i>someone else</i> to do as a startup?<br><br><b>4. Derivative Idea</b><br><br>Many of the applications we get are imitations of some existing company.  That's one source of ideas, but not the best.  If you look at the origins of successful startups, few were started in imitation of some other startup.  Where did they get their ideas? Usually from some specific, unsolved problem the founders identified.<br><br>Our startup made software for making online stores.  When we started it, there wasn't any; the few sites you could order from were hand-made at great expense by web consultants.  We knew that if online shopping ever took off, these sites would have to be generated by software, so we wrote some.  Pretty straightforward.<br><br>It seems like the best problems to solve are ones that affect you personally.  Apple happened because Steve Wozniak wanted a computer, Google because Larry and Sergey couldn't find stuff online, Hotmail because Sabeer Bhatia and Jack Smith couldn't exchange email at work.<br><br>So instead of copying the Facebook, with some variation that the Facebook rightly ignored, look for ideas from the other direction. Instead of starting from companies and working back to the problems they solved, look for problems and imagine the company that might solve them.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font> What do people complain about?  What do you wish there was?<br><br><b>5. Obstinacy</b><br><br>In some fields the way to succeed is to have a vision of what you want to achieve, and to hold true to it no matter what setbacks you encounter.  Starting startups is not one of them.  The stick-to-your-vision approach works for something like winning an Olympic gold medal, where the problem is well-defined.  Startups are more like science, where you need to follow the trail wherever it leads.<br><br>So don't get too attached to your original plan, because it's probably wrong.  Most successful startups end up doing something different than they originally intended&mdash;often so different that it doesn't even seem like the same company.  You have to be prepared to see the better idea when it arrives.  And the hardest part of that is often discarding your old idea.<br><br>But openness to new ideas has to be tuned just right.  Switching to a new idea every week will be equally fatal.  Is there some kind of external test you can use?  One is to ask whether the ideas represent some kind of progression.  If in each new idea you're able to re-use most of what you built for the previous ones, then you're probably in a process that converges.  Whereas if you keep restarting from scratch, that's a bad sign.<br><br>Fortunately there's someone you can ask for advice: your users.  If you're thinking about turning in some new direction and your users seem excited about it, it's probably a good bet.<br><br><b>6. Hiring Bad Programmers</b><br><br>I forgot to include this in the early versions of the list, because nearly all the founders I know are programmers.  This is not a serious problem for them.  They might accidentally hire someone bad, but it's not going to kill the company.  In a pinch they can do whatever's required themselves.<br><br>But when I think about what killed most of the startups in the e-commerce business back in the 90s, it was bad programmers.  A lot of those companies were started by business guys who thought the way startups worked was that you had some clever idea and then hired programmers to implement it.  That's actually much harder than it sounds&mdash;almost impossibly hard in fact&mdash;because business guys can't tell which are the good programmers.  They don't even get a shot at the best ones, because no one really good wants a job implementing the vision of a business guy.<br><br>In practice what happens is that the business guys choose people they think are good programmers (it says here on his resume that he's a Microsoft Certified Developer) but who aren't.  Then they're mystified to find that their startup lumbers along like a World War II bomber while their competitors scream past like jet fighters. This kind of startup is in the same position as a big company, but without the advantages.<br><br>So how do you pick good programmers if you're not a programmer?  I don't think there's an answer.  I was about to say you'd have to find a good programmer to help you hire people.  But if you can't recognize good programmers, how would you even do that?<br><br><b>7. Choosing the Wrong Platform</b><br><br>A related problem (since it tends to be done by bad programmers) is choosing the wrong platform.  For example, I think a lot of startups during the Bubble killed themselves by deciding to build server-based applications on Windows.  Hotmail was still running on FreeBSD for years after Microsoft bought it, presumably because Windows couldn't handle the load.  If Hotmail's founders had chosen to use Windows, they would have been swamped.<br><br>PayPal only just dodged this bullet.  After they merged with X.com, the new CEO wanted to switch to Windows&mdash;even after PayPal cofounder Max Levchin showed that their software scaled only 1% as well on Windows as Unix.  Fortunately for PayPal they switched CEOs instead.<br><br>Platform is a vague word.  It could mean an operating system, or a programming language, or a "framework" built on top of a programming language.  It implies something that both supports and limits, like the foundation of a house.<br><br>The scary thing about platforms is that there are always some that seem to outsiders to be fine, responsible choices and yet, like Windows in the 90s, will destroy you if you choose them.  Java applets were probably the most spectacular example.  This was supposed to be the new way of delivering applications.  Presumably it killed just about 100% of the startups who believed that.<br><br>How do you pick the right platforms?  The usual way is to hire good programmers and let them choose.  But there is a trick you could use if you're not a programmer: visit a top computer science department and see what they use in research projects.<br><br><b>8. Slowness in Launching</b><br><br>Companies of all sizes have a hard time getting software done.  It's intrinsic to the medium; software is always 85% done.  It takes an effort of will to push through this and get something released to users. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>Startups make all kinds of excuses for delaying their launch.  Most are equivalent to the ones people use for procrastinating in everyday life.  There's something that needs to happen first.  Maybe.  But if the software were 100% finished and ready to launch at the push of a button, would they still be waiting?<br><br>One reason to launch quickly is that it forces you to actually <i>finish</i> some quantum of work.  Nothing is truly finished till it's released; you can see that from the rush of work that's always involved in releasing anything, no matter how finished you thought it was.  The other reason you need to launch is that it's only by bouncing your idea off users that you fully understand it.<br><br>Several distinct problems manifest themselves as delays in launching: working too slowly; not truly understanding the problem; fear of having to deal with users; fear of being judged; working on too many different things; excessive perfectionism.  Fortunately you can combat all of them by the simple expedient of forcing yourself to launch <i>something</i> fairly quickly.<br><br><b>9. Launching Too Early</b><br><br>Launching too slowly has probably killed a hundred times more startups than launching too fast, but it is possible to launch too fast.  The danger here is that you ruin your reputation.  You launch something, the early adopters try it out, and if it's no good they may never come back.<br><br>So what's the minimum you need to launch?  We suggest startups think about what they plan to do, identify a core that's both (a) useful on its own and (b) something that can be incrementally expanded into the whole project, and then get that done as soon as possible.<br><br>This is the same approach I (and many other programmers) use for writing software.  Think about the overall goal, then start by writing the smallest subset of it that does anything useful.  If it's a subset, you'll have to write it anyway, so in the worst case you won't be wasting your time.  But more likely you'll find that implementing a working subset is both good for morale and helps you see more clearly what the rest should do.<br><br>The early adopters you need to impress are fairly tolerant.  They don't expect a newly launched product to do everything; it just has to do <i>something</i>.<br><br><b>10. Having No Specific User in Mind</b><br><br>You can't build things users like without understanding them.  I mentioned earlier that the most successful startups seem to have begun by trying to solve a problem their founders had.  Perhaps there's a rule here: perhaps you create wealth in proportion to how well you understand the problem you're solving, and the problems you understand best are your own.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font><br><br>That's just a theory.  What's not a theory is the converse: if you're trying to solve problems you don't understand, you're hosed.<br><br>And yet a surprising number of founders seem willing to assume that someone, they're not sure exactly who, will want what they're building.  Do the founders want it?  No, they're not the target market.  Who is?  Teenagers.  People interested in local events (that one is a perennial tarpit).  Or "business" users.  What business users?  Gas stations?  Movie studios?  Defense contractors?<br><br>You can of course build something for users other than yourself. We did.  But you should realize you're stepping into dangerous territory.  You're flying on instruments, in effect, so you should (a) consciously shift gears, instead of assuming you can rely on your intuitions as you ordinarily would, and (b) look at the instruments.<br><br>In this case the instruments are the users.  When designing for other people you have to be empirical.  You can no longer guess what will work; you have to find users and measure their responses. So if you're going to make something for teenagers or "business" users or some other group that doesn't include you, you have to be able to talk some specific ones into using what you're making.  If you can't, you're on the wrong track.<br><br><b>11. Raising Too Little Money</b><br><br>Most successful startups take funding at some point.  Like having more than one founder, it seems a good bet statistically.  How much should you take, though?<br><br>Startup funding is measured in time.  Every startup that isn't profitable (meaning nearly all of them, initially) has a certain amount of time left before the money runs out and they have to stop. This is sometimes referred to as runway, as in "How much runway do you have left?"  It's a good metaphor because it reminds you that when the money runs out you're going to be airborne or dead.<br><br>Too little money means not enough to get airborne.  What airborne means depends on the situation.  Usually you have to advance to a visibly higher level: if all you have is an idea, a working prototype; if you have a prototype, launching; if you're launched, significant growth.  It depends on investors, because until you're profitable that's who you have to convince.<br><br>So if you take money from investors, you have to take enough to get to the next step, whatever that is. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font> Fortunately you have some control over both how much you spend and what the next step is.  We advise startups to set both low, initially: spend practically nothing, and make your initial goal simply to build a solid prototype. This gives you maximum flexibility.<br><br><b>12. Spending Too Much</b><br><br>It's hard to distinguish spending too much from raising too little. If you run out of money, you could say either was the cause.  The only way to decide which to call it is by comparison with other startups.  If you raised five million and ran out of money, you probably spent too much.<br><br>Burning through too much money is not as common as it used to be. Founders seem to have learned that lesson.  Plus it keeps getting cheaper to start a startup.  So as of this writing few startups spend too much.  None of the ones we've funded have.  (And not just because we make small investments; many have gone on to raise further rounds.)<br><br>The classic way to burn through cash is by hiring a lot of people. This bites you twice: in addition to increasing your costs, it slows you down&mdash;so money that's getting consumed faster has to last longer.  Most hackers understand why that happens; Fred Brooks explained it in The Mythical Man-Month.<br><br>We have three general suggestions about hiring: (a) don't do it if you can avoid it, (b) pay people with equity rather than salary, not just to save money, but because you want the kind of people who are committed enough to prefer that, and (c) only hire people who are either going to write code or go out and get users, because those are the only things you need at first.<br><br><b>13. Raising Too Much Money</b><br><br>It's obvious how too little money could kill you, but is there such a thing as having too much?<br><br>Yes and no.  The problem is not so much the money itself as what comes with it.  As one VC who spoke at Y Combinator said, "Once you take several million dollars of my money, the clock is ticking." If VCs fund you, they're not going to let you just put the money in the bank and keep operating as two guys living on ramen.  They want that money to go to work.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font> At the very least you'll move into proper office space and hire more people.  That will change the atmosphere, and not entirely for the better.  Now most of your people will be employees rather than founders. They won't be as committed; they'll need to be told what to do; they'll start to engage in office politics.<br><br>When you raise a lot of money, your company moves to the suburbs and has kids.<br><br>Perhaps more dangerously, once you take a lot of money it gets harder to change direction.  Suppose your initial plan was to sell something to companies.  After taking VC money you hire a sales force to do that. What happens now if you realize you should be making this for consumers instead of businesses?  That's a completely different kind of selling.  What happens, in practice, is that you don't realize that.  The more people you have, the more you stay pointed in the same direction.<br><br>Another drawback of large investments is the time they take.  The time required to raise money grows with the amount. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font> When the amount rises into the millions, investors get very cautious.  VCs never quite say yes or no; they just engage you in an apparently endless conversation.  Raising VC scale investments is thus a huge time sink&mdash;more work, probably, than the startup itself.   And you don't want to be spending all your time talking to investors while your competitors are spending theirs building things.<br><br>We advise founders who go on to seek VC money to take the first reasonable deal they get.  If you get an offer from a reputable firm at a reasonable valuation with no unusually onerous terms, just take it and get on with building the company. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font> Who cares if you could get a 30% better deal elsewhere?  Economically, startups are an all-or-nothing game.  Bargain-hunting among investors is a waste of time.<br><br><b>14. Poor Investor Management</b><br><br>As a founder, you have to manage your investors.  You shouldn't ignore them, because they may have useful insights.  But neither should you let them run the company.  That's supposed to be your job.  If investors had sufficient vision to run the companies they fund, why didn't they start them?<br><br>Pissing off investors by ignoring them is probably less dangerous than caving in to them.  In our startup, we erred on the ignoring side.  A lot of our energy got drained away in disputes with investors instead of going into the product. But this was less costly than giving in, which would probably have destroyed the company.  If the founders know what they're doing, it's better to have half their attention focused on the product than the full attention of investors who don't.<br><br>How hard you have to work on managing investors usually depends on how much money you've taken.  When you raise VC-scale money, the investors get a great deal of control.  If they have a board majority, they're literally your bosses.  In the more common case, where founders and investors are equally represented and the deciding vote is cast by neutral outside directors, all the investors have to do is convince the outside directors and they control the company.<br><br>If things go well, this shouldn't matter.  So long as you seem to be advancing rapidly, most investors will leave you alone.  But things don't always go smoothly in startups.  Investors have made trouble even for the most successful companies.  One of the most famous examples is Apple, whose board made a nearly fatal blunder in firing Steve Jobs.  Apparently even Google got a lot of grief from their investors early on.<br><br><b>15. Sacrificing Users to (Supposed) Profit</b><br><br>When I said at the beginning that if you make something users want, you'll be fine, you may have noticed I didn't mention anything about having the right business model.  That's not because making money is unimportant.  I'm not suggesting that founders start companies with no chance of making money in the hope of unloading them before they tank.  The reason we tell founders not to worry about the business model initially is that making something people want is so much harder.<br><br>I don't know why it's so hard to make something people want.  It seems like it should be straightforward.  But you can tell it must be hard by how few startups do it.<br><br>Because making something people want is so much harder than making money from it, you should leave business models for later, just as you'd leave some trivial but messy feature for version 2.  In version 1, solve the core problem.  And the core problem in a startup is how to <a href="wealth.html">create wealth</a>  (= how much people want something x the number who want it), not how to convert that wealth into money.<br><br>The companies that win are the ones that put users first.  Google, for example.  They made search work, then worried about how to make money from it.  And yet some startup founders still think it's irresponsible not to focus on the business model from the beginning. They're often encouraged in this by investors whose experience comes from less malleable industries.<br><br>It <i>is</i> irresponsible not to think about business models.  It's just ten times more irresponsible not to think about the product.<br><br><b>16. Not Wanting to Get Your Hands Dirty</b><br><br>Nearly all programmers would rather spend their time writing code and have someone else handle the messy business of extracting money from it.  And not just the lazy ones.  Larry and Sergey apparently felt this way too at first.  After developing their new search algorithm, the first thing they tried was to get some other company to buy it.<br><br>Start a company?  Yech.  Most hackers would rather just have ideas. But as Larry and Sergey found, there's not much of a market for ideas.  No one trusts an idea till you embody it in a product and use that to grow a user base.  Then they'll pay big time.<br><br>Maybe this will change, but I doubt it will change much.  There's nothing like users for convincing acquirers.  It's not just that the risk is decreased.  The acquirers are human, and they have a hard time paying a bunch of young guys millions of dollars just for being clever.  When the idea is embodied in a company with a lot of users, they can tell themselves they're buying the users rather than the cleverness, and this is easier for them to swallow. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>If you're going to attract users, you'll probably have to get up from your computer and go find some.  It's unpleasant work, but if you can make yourself do it you have a much greater chance of succeeding.  In the first batch of startups we funded, in the summer of 2005, most of the founders spent all their time building their applications.  But there was one who was away half the time talking to executives at cell phone companies, trying to arrange deals. Can you imagine anything more painful for a hacker? <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f10n"><font color="#777777">10</font></a>]</font> But it paid off, because this startup seems the most successful of that group by an order of magnitude.<br><br>If you want to start a startup, you have to face the fact that you can't just hack.  At least one hacker will have to spend some of the time doing business stuff.<br><br><b>17. Fights Between Founders</b><br><br>Fights between founders are surprisingly common.  About 20% of the startups we've funded have had a founder leave.  It happens so often that we've reversed our attitude to vesting.  We still don't require it, but now we advise founders to vest so there will be an orderly way for people to quit.<br><br>A founder leaving doesn't necessarily kill a startup, though.  Plenty of successful startups have had that happen.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f11n"><font color="#777777">11</font></a>]</font> Fortunately it's usually the least committed founder who leaves.  If there are three founders and one who was lukewarm leaves, big deal.  If you have two and one leaves, or a guy with critical technical skills leaves, that's more of a problem.  But even that is survivable.  Blogger got down to one person, and they bounced back.<br><br>Most of the disputes I've seen between founders could have been avoided if they'd been more careful about who they started a company with.  Most disputes are not due to the situation but the people. Which means they're inevitable.  And most founders who've been burned by such disputes probably had misgivings, which they suppressed, when they started the company.  Don't suppress misgivings.  It's much easier to fix problems before the company is started than after.  So don't include your housemate in your startup because he'd feel left out otherwise.  Don't start a company with someone you dislike because they have some skill you need and you worry you won't find anyone else.  The people are the most important ingredient in a startup, so don't compromise there.<br><br><b>18. A Half-Hearted Effort</b><br><br>The failed startups you hear most about are the spectactular flameouts.  Those are actually the elite of failures.  The most common type is not the one that makes spectacular mistakes, but the one that doesn't do much of anything&mdash;the one we never even hear about, because it was some project a couple guys started on the side while working on their day jobs, but which never got anywhere and was gradually abandoned.<br><br>Statistically, if you want to avoid failure, it would seem like the most important thing is to quit your day job.  Most founders of failed startups don't quit their day jobs, and most founders of successful ones do.  If startup failure were a disease, the CDC would be issuing bulletins warning people to avoid day jobs.<br><br>Does that mean you should quit your day job?  Not necessarily.  I'm guessing here, but I'd guess that many of these would-be founders may not have the kind of determination it takes to start a company, and that in the back of their minds, they know it.  The reason they don't invest more time in their startup is that they know it's a bad investment. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f12n"><font color="#777777">12</font></a>]</font><br><br>I'd also guess there's some band of people who could have succeeded if they'd taken the leap and done it full-time, but didn't. I have no idea how wide this band is, but if the winner/borderline/hopeless progression has the sort of distribution you'd expect, the number of people who could have made it, if they'd quit their day job, is probably an order of magnitude larger than the number who do make it. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f13n"><font color="#777777">13</font></a>]</font><br><br>If that's true, most startups that could succeed fail because the founders don't devote their whole efforts to them.  That certainly accords with what I see out in the world.  Most startups fail because they don't make something people want, and the reason most don't is that they don't try hard enough.<br><br>In other words, starting startups is just like everything else. The biggest mistake you can make is not to try hard enough.  To the extent there's a secret to success, it's not to be in denial about that.<br><br><br><br> <b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] This is not a complete list of the causes of failure, just those you can control.  There are also several you can't, notably ineptitude and bad luck.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] Ironically, one variant of the Facebook that might work is a facebook exclusively for college students.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] Steve Jobs tried to motivate people by saying "Real artists ship."  This is a fine sentence, but unfortunately not true.  Many famous works of art are unfinished.  It's true in fields that have hard deadlines, like architecture and filmmaking, but even there people tend to be tweaking stuff till it's yanked out of their hands.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>] There's probably also a second factor: startup founders tend to be at the leading edge of technology, so problems they face are probably especially valuable.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>] You should take more than you think you'll need, maybe 50% to 100% more, because software takes longer to write and deals longer to close than you expect.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>] Since people sometimes call us VCs, I should add that we're not.  VCs invest large amounts of other people's money.  We invest small amounts of our own, like angel investors.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>] Not linearly of course, or it would take forever to raise five million dollars.  In practice it just feels like it takes forever.<br><br>Though if you include the cases where VCs don't invest, it would literally take forever in the median case.  And maybe we should, because the danger of chasing large investments is not just that they take a long time.  That's the <i>best</i> case.  The real danger is that you'll expend a lot of time and get nothing.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>] Some VCs will offer you an artificially low valuation to see if you have the balls to ask for more.  It's lame that VCs play such games, but some do.  If you're dealing with one of those you should push back on the valuation a bit.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>] Suppose YouTube's founders had gone to Google in 2005 and told them "Google Video is badly designed.  Give us $10 million and we'll tell you all the mistakes you made."  They would have gotten the royal raspberry.  Eighteen months later Google paid $1.6 billion for the same lesson, partly because they could then tell themselves that they were buying a phenomenon, or a community, or some vague thing like that.<br><br>I don't mean to be hard on Google.  They did better than their competitors, who may have now missed the video boat entirely.<br><br>[<a name="f10n"><font color="#000000">10</font></a>] Yes, actually: dealing with the government.  But phone companies are up there.<br><br>[<a name="f11n"><font color="#000000">11</font></a>] Many more than most people realize, because companies don't advertise this.  Did you know Apple originally had three founders?<br><br>[<a name="f12n"><font color="#000000">12</font></a>] I'm not dissing these people.  I don't have the determination myself.  I've twice come close to starting startups since Viaweb, and both times I bailed because I realized that without the spur of poverty I just wasn't willing to endure the stress of a startup.<br><br>[<a name="f13n"><font color="#000000">13</font></a>] So how do you know whether you're in the category of people who should quit their day job, or the presumably larger one who shouldn't?  I got to the point of saying that this was hard to judge for yourself and that you should seek outside advice, before realizing that that's what we do.  We think of ourselves as investors, but viewed from the other direction Y Combinator is a service for advising people whether or not to quit their day job.  We could be mistaken, and no doubt often are, but we do at least bet money on our conclusions.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, Greg McAdoo, and Robert Morris  for reading drafts of this. <!-- <a href="http://reddit.com"><img src="http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/paulgraham/redditino.png" border=0></a> <a href="http://reddit.com/info/me0s/comments"> Comment</a> on this essay. --><br><br></p></font>

Mathematicians don't answer questions by working them out on paper the way schoolchildren are taught to.  They do more in their heads: they try to understand a problem space well enough that they can walk around it the way you can walk around the memory of the house you grew up in.  At its best programming is the same.  You hold the whole program in your head, and you can manipulate it at will.<br><br>That's particularly valuable at the start of a project, because initially the most important thing is to be able to change what you're doing.  Not just to solve the problem in a different way, but to change the problem you're solving.<br><br>Your code is your understanding of the problem you're exploring. So it's only when you have your code in your head that you really understand the problem.<br><br>It's not easy to get a program into your head.  If you leave a project for a few months, it can take days to really understand it again when you return to it.  Even when you're actively working on a program it can take half an hour to load into your head when you start work each day.  And that's in the best case.  Ordinary programmers working in typical office conditions never enter this mode.  Or to put it more dramatically, ordinary programmers working in typical office conditions never really understand the problems they're solving.<br><br>Even the best programmers don't always have the whole program they're working on loaded into their heads.   But there are things you can do to help:<br><br><ol> <li> <b>Avoid distractions.</b>  Distractions are bad for many types of work,    but especially bad for programming, because programmers tend to    operate at the limit of the detail they can handle.<br><br>The danger of a distraction depends not on how long it is, but    on how much it scrambles your brain.  A programmer can leave the    office and go and get a sandwich without losing the code in his    head.  But the wrong kind of interruption can wipe your brain    in 30 seconds.<br><br>Oddly enough, scheduled distractions may be worse than unscheduled    ones.  If you know you have a meeting in an hour, you don't even    start working on something hard.<br><br> </li> <li> <b>Work in long stretches.</b>  Since there's a fixed cost each time    you start working on a program, it's more efficient to work in    a few long sessions than many short ones.  There will of course    come a point where you get stupid because you're tired.  This    varies from person to person.  I've heard of people hacking for    36 hours straight, but the most I've ever been able to manage    is about 18, and I work best in chunks of no more than 12.<br><br>The optimum is not the limit you can physically endure.  There's    an advantage as well as a cost of breaking up a project.  Sometimes    when you return to a problem after a rest, you find your unconscious    mind has left an answer waiting for you.<br><br> </li> <li> <b>Use succinct languages.</b>  More     <a href="power.html">powerful</a> programming languages    make programs shorter. And programmers seem to think of programs    at least partially in the language they're using to write them.    The more succinct the language, the shorter the program, and the    easier it is to load and keep in your head.<br><br>You can magnify the effect of a powerful language by using a    style called bottom-up programming, where you write programs in    multiple layers, the lower ones acting as programming languages    for those above.  If you do this right, you only have to keep    the topmost layer in your head.<br><br> </li> <li> <b>Keep rewriting your program.</b>  Rewriting a program often yields    a cleaner design.  But it would have advantages even if it didn't:    you have to understand a program completely to rewrite it, so    there is no better way to get one loaded into your head.<br><br> </li> <li> <b>Write rereadable code.</b>  All programmers know it's good to write    readable code.  But you yourself are the most important reader.    Especially in the beginning; a prototype is a conversation with    yourself.  And when writing for yourself you have different    priorities.  If you're writing for other people, you may not    want to make code too dense.  Some parts of a program may be    easiest to read if you spread things out, like an introductory     textbook.  Whereas if you're writing code to make it easy to reload     into your head, it may be best to go for brevity.<br><br> </li> <li> <b>Work in small groups.</b>  When you manipulate a program in your    head, your vision tends to stop at the edge of the code you own.    Other parts you don't understand as well, and more importantly,    can't take liberties with.  So the smaller the number of    programmers, the more completely a project can mutate.  If there's    just one programmer, as there often is at first, you can do    all-encompassing redesigns.<br><br> </li> <li> <b>Don't have multiple people editing the same piece of code.</b>  You    never understand other people's code as well as your own.  No    matter how thoroughly you've read it, you've only read it, not    written it.  So if a piece of code is written by multiple authors,    none of them understand it as well as a single author would.<br><br>And of course you can't safely redesign something other people    are working on.  It's not just that you'd have to ask permission.    You don't even let yourself think of such things.  Redesigning    code with several authors is like changing laws; redesigning    code you alone control is like seeing the other interpretation    of an ambiguous image.<br><br>If you want to put several people to work on a project, divide    it into components and give each to one person.<br><br> </li> <li> <b>Start small.</b>  A program gets easier to hold in your head as you    become familiar with it.  You can start to treat parts as black    boxes once you feel confident you've fully explored them.  But    when you first start working on a project, you're forced to see    everything.  If you start with too big a problem, you may never    quite be able to encompass it.  So if you need to write a big,    complex program, the best way to begin may not be to write a    spec for it, but to write a prototype that solves a subset of    the problem.  Whatever the advantages of planning, they're often    outweighed by the advantages of being able to keep a program in    your head. </li> </ol> It's striking how often programmers manage to hit all eight points by accident.  Someone has an idea for a new project, but because it's not officially sanctioned, he has to do it in off hours&mdash;which turn out to be more productive because there are no distractions. Driven by his enthusiasm for the new project he works on it for many hours at a stretch.  Because it's initially just an experiment, instead of a "production" language he uses a mere "scripting" language&mdash;which is in fact far more powerful.  He completely rewrites the program several times; that wouldn't be justifiable for an official project, but this is a labor of love and he wants it to be perfect.  And since no one is going to see it except him, he omits any comments except the note-to-self variety. He works in a small group perforce, because he either hasn't told anyone else about the idea yet, or it seems so unpromising that no one else is allowed to work on it.  Even if there is a group, they couldn't have multiple people editing the same code, because it changes too fast for that to be possible.  And the project starts small because the idea <i>is</i> small at first; he just has some cool hack he wants to try out.<br><br>Even more striking are the number of officially sanctioned projects that manage to do <i>all eight things wrong</i>.  In fact, if you look at the way software gets written in most organizations, it's almost as if they were deliberately trying to do things wrong. In a sense, they are.  One of the defining qualities of organizations since there have been such a thing is to treat individuals as interchangeable parts.  This works well for more parallelizable tasks, like fighting wars.  For most of history a well-drilled army of professional soldiers could be counted on to beat an army of individual warriors, no matter how valorous.  But having ideas is not very parallelizable. And that's what programs are: ideas.<br><br>It's not merely true that organizations dislike the idea of depending on individual genius, it's a tautology.  It's part of the definition of an organization not to.  Of our current concept of an organization, at least.<br><br>Maybe we could define a new kind of organization that combined the efforts of individuals without requiring them to be interchangeable. Arguably a market is such a form of organization, though it may be more accurate to describe a market as a degenerate case&mdash;as what you get by default when organization isn't possible.<br><br>Probably the best we'll do is some kind of hack, like making the programming parts of an organization work differently from the rest. Perhaps the optimal solution is for big companies not even to try to develop ideas in house, but simply to  <a href="hiring.html">buy</a> them.  But regardless of what the solution turns out to be, the first step is to realize there's a problem.  There is a contradiction in the very phrase "software company."   The two words are pulling in opposite directions. Any good programmer in a large organization is going to be at odds with it, because organizations are designed to prevent what programmers strive for.<br><br><xa href="gh.html">Good programmers manage to get a lot done anyway.   But often it requires practically an act of rebellion against the organizations that employ them.  Perhaps it will help if more people understand that the way programmers behave is driven by the demands of the work they do. It's not because they're irresponsible that they work in long binges during which they blow off all other obligations, plunge straight into programming instead of writing specs first, and rewrite code that already works.  It's not because they're unfriendly that they prefer to work alone, or growl at people who pop their head in the door to say hello.  This apparently random collection of annoying habits has a single explanation: the power of holding a program in one's head.<br><br>Whether or not understanding this can help large organizations, it can certainly help their competitors.  The weakest point in big companies is that they don't let individual programmers do great work.  So if you're a little startup, this is the place to attack them.  Take on the kind of problems that have to be solved in one big brain.<br><br><br><br><br><br> <b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, David Greenspan, Aaron Iba, Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, Peter Norvig, Lisa Randall, Emmett Shear, Sergei Tsarev, and Stephen Wolfram for reading drafts of this.<br><br></xa></font>

You can sense it when you walk around one.  In a hundred subtle ways, the city sends you a message: you could do more; you should try harder.<br><br>The surprising thing is how different these messages can be.  New York tells you, above all: you should make more money.  There are other messages too, of course.  You should be hipper.  You should be better looking.  But the clearest message is that you should be richer.<br><br>What I like about Boston (or rather Cambridge) is that the message there is: you should be smarter.  You really should get around to reading all those books you've been meaning to.<br><br>When you ask what message a city sends, you sometimes get surprising answers.  As much as they respect brains in Silicon Valley, the message the Valley sends is: you should be more powerful.<br><br>That's not quite the same message New York sends.  Power matters in New York too of course, but New York is pretty impressed by a billion dollars even if you merely inherited it.  In Silicon Valley no one would care except a few real estate agents.  What matters in Silicon Valley is how much effect you have on the world.  The reason people there care about Larry and Sergey is not their wealth but the fact that they control Google, which affects practically everyone.<br><br></font><center>_____</center> <br><br>How much does it matter what message a city sends?  Empirically, the answer seems to be: a lot. You might think that if you had enough strength of mind to do great things, you'd be able to transcend your environment.  Where you live should make at most a couple percent difference.  But if you look at the historical evidence, it seems to matter more than that.  Most people who did great things were clumped together in a few places where that sort of thing was done at the time.<br><br>You can see how powerful cities are from something I wrote about <a href="taste.html">earlier</a>: the case of the Milanese Leonardo.   Practically every fifteenth century Italian painter you've heard of was from Florence, even though Milan was just as big.  People in Florence weren't genetically different, so you have to assume there was someone born in Milan with as much natural ability as Leonardo.  What happened to him?<br><br>If even someone with the same natural ability as Leonardo couldn't beat the force of environment, do you suppose you can?<br><br>I don't.  I'm fairly stubborn, but I wouldn't try to fight this force.  I'd rather use it.  So I've thought a lot about where to live.<br><br>I'd always imagined Berkeley would be the ideal place&mdash;that it would basically be Cambridge with good weather.  But when I finally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned out not to be.  The message Berkeley sends is: you should live better.  Life in Berkeley is very civilized.  It's probably the place in America where someone from Northern Europe would feel most at home.  But it's not humming with ambition.<br><br>In retrospect it shouldn't have been surprising that a place so pleasant would attract people interested above all in quality of life.  Cambridge with good weather, it turns out, is not Cambridge. The people you find in Cambridge are not there by accident.  You have to make sacrifices to live there.  It's expensive and somewhat grubby, and the weather's often bad.  So the kind of people you find in Cambridge are the kind of people who want to live where the smartest people are, even if that means living in an expensive, grubby place with bad weather.<br><br>As of this writing, Cambridge seems to be the intellectual capital of the world.  I realize that seems a preposterous claim.  What makes it true is that it's more preposterous to claim about anywhere else.  American universities currently seem to be the best, judging from the flow of ambitious students.  And what US city has a stronger claim?  New York?  A fair number of smart people, but diluted by a much larger number of neanderthals in suits.  The Bay Area has a lot of smart people too, but again, diluted;  there are two great universities, but they're far apart.  Harvard and MIT are practically adjacent by West Coast standards, and they're surrounded by about 20 other colleges and universities. <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Cambridge as a result feels like a town whose main industry is ideas, while New York's is finance and Silicon Valley's is startups.<br><br><center>_____</center> <br><br>When you talk about cities in the sense we are, what you're really talking about is collections of people.  For a long time cities were the only large collections of people, so you could use the two ideas interchangeably.  But we can see how much things are changing from the examples I've mentioned.  New York is a classic great city. But Cambridge is just part of a city, and Silicon Valley is not even that.  (San Jose is not, as it sometimes claims, the capital of Silicon Valley.  It's just 178 square miles at one end of it.)<br><br>Maybe the Internet will change things further.  Maybe one day the most important community you belong to will be a virtual one, and it won't matter where you live physically.  But I wouldn't bet on it.  The physical world is very high bandwidth, and some of the ways cities send you messages are quite subtle.<br><br>One of the exhilarating things about coming back to Cambridge every spring is walking through the streets at dusk, when you can see into the houses.  When you walk through Palo Alto in the evening, you see nothing but the blue glow of TVs.  In Cambridge you see shelves full of promising-looking books.  Palo Alto was probably much like Cambridge in 1960, but you'd never guess now that there was a university nearby.  Now it's just one of the richer neighborhoods in Silicon Valley.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>A city speaks to you mostly by accident&mdash;in things you see through windows, in conversations you overhear.  It's not something you have to seek out, but something you can't turn off.  One of the occupational hazards of living in Cambridge is overhearing the conversations of people who use interrogative intonation in declarative sentences.  But on average I'll take Cambridge conversations over New York or Silicon Valley ones.<br><br>A friend who moved to Silicon Valley in the late 90s said the worst thing about living there was the low quality of the eavesdropping. At the time I thought she was being deliberately eccentric. Sure, it can be interesting to eavesdrop on people, but is good quality eavesdropping so important that it would affect where you chose to live?  Now I understand what she meant.  The conversations you overhear tell you what sort of people you're among.<br><br><center>_____</center> <br><br>No matter how determined you are, it's hard not to be influenced by the people around you.  It's not so much that you do whatever a city expects of you, but that you get discouraged when no one around you cares about the same things you do.<br><br>There's an imbalance between encouragement and discouragement like that between gaining and losing money.  Most people overvalue negative amounts of money: they'll work much harder to avoid losing a dollar than to gain one.  Similarly, though there are plenty of people strong enough to resist doing something just because that's what one is supposed to do where they happen to be, there are few strong enough to keep working on something no one around them cares about.<br><br>Because ambitions are to some extent incompatible and admiration is a zero-sum game, each city tends to focus on one type of ambition. The reason Cambridge is the intellectual capital is not just that there's a concentration of smart people there, but that there's nothing <i>else</i> people there care about more.  Professors in New York and the Bay area are second class citizens&mdash;till they start hedge funds or startups respectively.<br><br>This suggests an answer to a question people in New York have wondered about since the Bubble: whether New York could grow into a startup hub to rival Silicon Valley.  One reason that's unlikely is that someone starting a startup in New York would feel like a second class citizen.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font> There's already something else people in New York admire more.<br><br>In the long term, that could be a bad thing for New York.  The power of an important new technology does eventually convert to money. So by caring more about money and less about power than Silicon Valley, New York is recognizing the same thing, but slower. <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#999999">4</font></a>]</font> And in fact it has been losing to Silicon Valley at its own game: the ratio of New York to California residents in the Forbes 400 has decreased from 1.45 (81:56) when the list was first published in 1982 to .83 (73:88) in 2007.<br><br><center>_____</center> <br><br>Not all cities send a message.  Only those that are centers for some type of ambition do.  And it can be hard to tell exactly what message a city sends without living there.  I understand the messages of New York, Cambridge, and Silicon Valley because I've lived for several years in each of them.  DC and LA seem to send messages too, but I haven't spent long enough in either to say for sure what they are.<br><br>The big thing in LA seems to be fame.  There's an A List of people who are most in demand right now, and what's most admired is to be on it, or friends with those who are.  Beneath that the message is much like New York's, though perhaps with more emphasis on physical attractiveness.<br><br>In DC the message seems to be that the most important thing is who you know.  You want to be an insider.  In practice this seems to work much as in LA.  There's an A List and you want to be on it or close to those who are.  The only difference is how the A List is selected.  And even that is not that different.<br><br>At the moment, San Francisco's message seems to be the same as Berkeley's: you should live better.  But this will change if enough startups choose SF over the Valley.  During the Bubble that was a predictor of failure&mdash;a self-indulgent choice, like buying expensive office furniture.  Even now I'm suspicious when startups choose SF.  But if enough good ones do, it stops being a self-indulgent choice, because the center of gravity of Silicon Valley will shift there.<br><br>I haven't found anything like Cambridge for intellectual ambition. Oxford and Cambridge (England) feel like Ithaca or Hanover: the message is there, but not as strong.<br><br>Paris was once a great intellectual center.  If you went there in 1300, it might have sent the message Cambridge does now.  But I tried living there for a bit last year, and the ambitions of the inhabitants are not intellectual ones.  The message Paris sends now is: do things with style.  I liked that, actually.  Paris is the only city I've lived in where people genuinely cared about art.  In America only a few rich people buy original art, and even the more sophisticated ones rarely get past judging it by the brand name of the artist.  But looking through windows at dusk in Paris you can see that people there actually care what paintings look like. Visually, Paris has the best eavesdropping I know.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#999999">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>There's one more message I've heard from cities: in London you can still (barely) hear the message that one should be more aristocratic. If you listen for it you can also hear it in Paris, New York, and Boston.  But this message is everywhere very faint.  It would have been strong 100 years ago, but now I probably wouldn't have picked it up at all if I hadn't deliberately tuned in to that wavelength to see if there was any signal left.<br><br><center>_____</center> <br><br>So far the complete list of messages I've picked up from cities is: wealth, style, hipness, physical attractiveness, fame, political power, economic power, intelligence, social class, and quality of life.<br><br>My immediate reaction to this list is that it makes me slightly queasy.  I'd always considered ambition a good thing, but I realize now that was because I'd always implicitly understood it to mean ambition in the areas I cared about.  When you list everything ambitious people are ambitious about, it's not so pretty.<br><br>On closer examination I see a couple things on the list that are surprising in the light of history.  For example, physical attractiveness wouldn't have been there 100 years ago (though it might have been 2400 years ago).  It has always mattered for women, but in the late twentieth century it seems to have started to matter for men as well.  I'm not sure why&mdash;probably some combination of the increasing power of women, the increasing influence of actors as models, and the fact that so many people work in offices now: you can't show off by wearing clothes too fancy to wear in a factory, so you have to show off with your body instead.<br><br>Hipness is another thing you wouldn't have seen on the list 100 years ago.  Or wouldn't you?  What it means is to know what's what. So maybe it has simply replaced the component of social class that consisted of being "au fait."  That could explain why hipness seems particularly admired in London: it's version 2 of the traditional English delight in obscure codes that only insiders understand.<br><br>Economic power would have been on the list 100 years ago, but what we mean by it is changing.  It used to mean the control of vast human and material resources.  But increasingly it means the ability to direct the course of technology, and some of the people in a position to do that are not even rich&mdash;leaders of important open source projects, for example.  The Captains of Industry of times past had laboratories full of clever people cooking up new technologies for them.  The new breed are themselves those people.<br><br>As this force gets more attention, another is dropping off the list: social class.  I think the two changes are related.  Economic power, wealth, and social class are just names for the same thing at different stages in its life: economic power converts to wealth, and wealth to social class.  So the focus of admiration is simply shifting upstream.<br><br><center>_____</center> <br><br>Does anyone who wants to do great work have to live in a great city? No; all great cities inspire some sort of ambition, but they aren't the only places that do.  For some kinds of work, all you need is a handful of talented colleagues.<br><br>What cities provide is an audience, and a funnel for peers.  These aren't so critical in something like math or physics, where no audience matters except your peers, and judging ability is sufficiently straightforward that hiring and admissions committees can do it reliably.  In a field like math or physics all you need is a department with the right colleagues in it.  It could be anywhere&mdash;in Los Alamos, New Mexico, for example.<br><br>It's in fields like the arts or writing or technology that the larger environment matters.  In these the best practitioners aren't conveniently collected in a few top university departments and research labs&mdash;partly because talent is harder to judge, and partly because people pay for these things, so one doesn't need to rely on teaching or research funding to support oneself.  It's in these more chaotic fields that it helps most to be in a great city: you need the encouragement of feeling that people around you care about the kind of work you do, and since you have to find peers for yourself, you need the much larger intake mechanism of a great city.<br><br>You don't have to live in a great city your whole life to benefit from it.  The critical years seem to be the early and middle ones of your career.  Clearly you don't have to grow up in a great city. Nor does it seem to matter if you go to college in one.  To most college students a world of a few thousand people seems big enough. Plus in college you don't yet have to face the hardest kind of work&mdash;discovering new problems to solve.<br><br>It's when you move on to the next and much harder step that it helps most to be in a place where you can find peers and encouragement. You seem to be able to leave, if you want, once you've found both. The Impressionists show the typical pattern: they were born all over France (Pissarro was born in the Carribbean) and died all over France, but what defined them were the years they spent together in Paris.<br><br><center>_____</center> <br><br>Unless you're sure what you want to do and where the leading center for it is, your best bet is probably to try living in several places when you're young.  You can never tell what message a city sends till you live there, or even whether it still sends one. Often your information will be wrong: I tried living in Florence when I was 25, thinking it would be an art center, but it turned out I was 450 years too late.<br><br>Even when a city is still a live center of ambition, you won't know for sure whether its message will resonate with you till you hear it.  When I moved to New York, I was very excited at first.  It's an exciting place.  So it took me quite a while to realize I just wasn't like the people there.  I kept searching for the Cambridge of New York.  It turned out it was way, way uptown: an hour uptown by air.<br><br>Some people know at 16 what sort of work they're going to do, but in most ambitious kids, ambition seems to precede anything specific to be ambitious about.  They know they want to do something great. They just haven't decided yet whether they're going to be a rock star or a brain surgeon.  There's nothing wrong with that.  But it means if you have this most common type of ambition, you'll probably have to figure out where to live by trial and error.  You'll probably have to find the city where you feel at home to know what sort of ambition you have.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] This is one of the advantages of not having the universities in your country controlled by the government.  When governments decide how to allocate resources, political deal-making causes things to be spread out geographically.  No central goverment would put its two best universities in the same town, unless it was the capital (which would cause other problems).  But scholars seem to like to cluster together as much as people in any other field, and when given the freedom to they derive the same advantages from it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] There are still a few old professors in Palo Alto, but one by one they die and their houses are transformed by developers into McMansions and sold to VPs of Bus Dev.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] How many times have you read about startup founders who continued to live inexpensively as their companies took off?  Who continued to dress in jeans and t-shirts, to drive the old car they had in grad school, and so on?  If you did that in New York, people would treat you like shit.  If you walk into a fancy restaurant in San Francisco wearing a jeans and a t-shirt, they're nice to you; who knows who you might be?  Not in New York.<br><br>One sign of a city's potential as a technology center is the number of restaurants that still require jackets for men.  According to Zagat's there are none in San Francisco, LA, Boston, or Seattle,  4 in DC, 6 in Chicago, 8 in London, 13 in New York, and 20 in Paris.<br><br>(Zagat's lists the Ritz Carlton Dining Room in SF as requiring jackets but I couldn't believe it, so I called to check and in fact they don't. Apparently there's only one restaurant left on the entire West Coast that still requires jackets: The French Laundry in Napa Valley.)<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>] Ideas are one step upstream from economic power, so it's conceivable that intellectual centers like Cambridge will one day have an edge over Silicon Valley like the one the Valley has over New York.<br><br>This seems unlikely at the moment; if anything Boston is falling further and further behind.  The only reason I even mention the possibility is that the path from ideas to startups has recently been getting smoother.  It's a lot easier now for a couple of hackers with no business experience to start a startup than it was 10 years ago.  If you extrapolate another 20 years, maybe the balance of power will start to shift back.  I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't bet against it either.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>] If Paris is where people care most about art, why is New York the center of gravity of the art business?  Because in the twentieth century, art as brand split apart from art as stuff.  New York is where the richest buyers are, but all they demand from art is brand, and since you can base brand on anything with a sufficiently identifiable style, you may as well use the local stuff.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell, Sarah Harlin, Jessica Livingston, Jackie McDonough, Robert Morris, and David Sloo for reading drafts of this.<br><br>

I think it's because some things about startups are kind of counterintuitive.<br><br>We've now  <a href="http://ycombinator.com">invested</a>  in enough companies that I've learned a trick for determining which points are the counterintuitive ones: they're the ones I have to keep repeating.<br><br>So I'm going to number these points, and maybe with future startups I'll be able to pull off a form of Huffman coding. I'll make them all read this, and then instead of nagging them in detail, I'll just be able to say: <i>number four!</i><br><br> <b>1. Release Early.</b><br><br>The thing I probably repeat most is this recipe for a startup: get a version 1 out fast, then improve it based on users' reactions.<br><br>By "release early" I don't mean you should release something full of bugs, but that you should release something minimal.  Users hate bugs, but they don't seem to mind a minimal version 1, if there's more coming soon.<br><br>There are several reasons it pays to get version 1 done fast.  One is that this is simply the right way to write software, whether for a startup or not.  I've been repeating that since 1993, and I haven't seen much since to contradict it.  I've seen a lot of startups die because they were too slow to release stuff, and none because they were too quick. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#777777">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>One of the things that will surprise you if you build something popular is that you won't know your users.  <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a> now has almost half a million unique visitors a month.  Who are all those people?  They have no idea.  No web startup does.  And since you don't know your users, it's dangerous to guess what they'll like.  Better to release something and let them tell you.<br><br><a href="http://wufoo.com">Wufoo</a> took this to heart and released their form-builder before the underlying database.  You can't even drive the thing yet, but 83,000 people came to sit in the driver's seat and hold the steering wheel.  And Wufoo got valuable feedback from it: Linux users complained they used too much Flash, so they rewrote their software not to.  If they'd waited to release everything at once, they wouldn't have discovered this problem till it was more deeply wired in.<br><br>Even if you had no users, it would still be important to release quickly, because for a startup the initial release acts as a shakedown cruise.  If anything major is broken-- if the idea's no good, for example, or the founders hate one another-- the stress of getting that first version out will expose it.  And if you have such problems you want to find them early.<br><br>Perhaps the most important reason to release early, though, is that it makes you work harder.  When you're working on something that isn't released, problems are intriguing.  In something that's out there, problems are alarming.  There is a lot more urgency once you release.  And I think that's precisely why people put it off.  They know they'll have to work a lot harder once they do.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#777777">2</font></a>]</font><br><br> <b>2. Keep Pumping Out Features.</b><br><br>Of course, "release early" has a second component, without which it would be bad advice.  If you're going to start with something that doesn't do much, you better improve it fast.<br><br>What I find myself repeating is "pump out features."  And this rule isn't just for the initial stages.  This is something all startups should do for as long as they want to be considered startups.<br><br>I don't mean, of course, that you should make your application ever more complex.  By "feature" I mean one unit of hacking-- one quantum of making users' lives better.<br><br>As with exercise, improvements beget improvements.  If you run every day, you'll probably feel like running tomorrow.  But if you skip running for a couple weeks, it will be an effort to drag yourself out.  So it is with hacking: the more ideas you implement, the more ideas you'll have.  You should make your system better at least in some small way every day or two.<br><br>This is not just a good way to get development done; it is also a form of marketing.  Users love a site that's constantly improving. In fact, users expect a site to improve.  Imagine if you visited a site that seemed very good, and then returned two months later and not one thing had changed.  Wouldn't it start to seem lame?  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#777777">3</font></a>]</font><br><br>They'll like you even better when you improve in response to their comments, because customers are used to companies ignoring them. If you're the rare exception-- a company that actually listens-- you'll generate fanatical loyalty.  You won't need to advertise, because your users will do it for you.<br><br>This seems obvious too, so why do I have to keep repeating it?  I think the problem here is that people get used to how things are. Once a product gets past the stage where it has glaring flaws, you start to get used to it, and gradually whatever features it happens to have become its identity.  For example, I doubt many people at Yahoo (or Google for that matter) realized how much better web mail could be till Paul Buchheit showed them.<br><br>I think the solution is to assume that anything you've made is far short of what it could be.  Force yourself, as a sort of intellectual exercise, to keep thinking of improvements.  Ok, sure, what you have is perfect.  But if you had to change something, what would it be?<br><br>If your product seems finished, there are two possible explanations: (a) it is finished, or (b) you lack imagination.  Experience suggests (b) is a thousand times more likely.<br><br> <b>3. Make Users Happy.</b><br><br>Improving constantly is an instance of a more general rule: make users happy.  One thing all startups have in common is that they can't force anyone to do anything.  They can't force anyone to use their software, and they can't force anyone to do deals with them. A startup has to sing for its supper.  That's why the successful ones make great things.  They have to, or die.<br><br>When you're running a startup you feel like a little bit of debris blown about by powerful winds.  The most powerful wind is users. They can either catch you and loft you up into the sky, as they did with Google, or leave you flat on the pavement, as they do with most startups.  Users are a fickle wind, but more powerful than any other.  If they take you up, no competitor can keep you down.<br><br>As a little piece of debris, the rational thing for you to do is not to lie flat, but to curl yourself into a shape the wind will catch.<br><br>I like the wind metaphor because it reminds you how impersonal the stream of traffic is.  The vast majority of people who visit your site will be casual visitors.  It's them you have to design your site for.  The people who really care will find what they want by themselves.<br><br>The median visitor will arrive with their finger poised on the Back button.  Think about your own experience: most links you follow lead to something lame.  Anyone who has used the web for more than a couple weeks has been <i>trained</i> to click on Back after following a link.  So your site has to say "Wait!  Don't click on Back.  This site isn't lame.  Look at this, for example."<br><br>There are two things you have to do to make people pause.  The most important is to explain, as concisely as possible, what the hell your site is about.  How often have you visited a site that seemed to assume you already knew what they did?  For example, the corporate <xa href="http://www.interwoven.com/company/">site that says the company makes <blockquote>   enterprise content management solutions for business that enable   organizations to unify people, content and processes to minimize   business risk, accelerate time-to-value and sustain lower total   cost of ownership. </blockquote> An established company may get away with such an opaque description, but no startup can.  A startup should be able to explain in one or two sentences exactly what it does.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f4n"><font color="#777777">4</font></a>]</font> And not just to users.  You need this for everyone: investors, acquirers, partners, reporters, potential employees, and even current employees.  You probably shouldn't even start a company to do something that can't be described compellingly in one or two sentences.<br><br>The other thing I repeat is to give people everything you've got, right away.  If you have something impressive, try to put it on the front page, because that's the only one most visitors will see. Though indeed there's a paradox here: the more you push the good stuff toward the front, the more likely visitors are to explore further.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f5n"><font color="#777777">5</font></a>]</font><br><br>In the best case these two suggestions get combined: you tell visitors what your site is about by <i>showing</i> them.  One of the standard pieces of advice in fiction writing is "show, don't tell." Don't say that a character's angry; have him grind his teeth, or break his pencil in half.  Nothing will explain what your site does so well as using it.<br><br>The industry term here is "conversion."  The job of your site is to convert casual visitors into users-- whatever your definition of a user is.  You can measure this in your growth rate.  Either your site is catching on, or it isn't, and you must know which.  If you have decent growth, you'll win in the end, no matter how obscure you are now.  And if you don't, you need to fix something.<br><br> <b>4. Fear the Right Things.</b><br><br>Another thing I find myself saying a lot is "don't worry."  Actually, it's more often "don't worry about this; worry about that instead." Startups are right to be paranoid, but they sometimes fear the wrong things.<br><br>Most visible disasters are not so alarming as they seem.  Disasters are normal in a startup: a founder quits, you discover a patent that covers what you're doing, your servers keep crashing, you run into an insoluble technical problem, you have to change your name, a deal falls through-- these are all par for the course.  They won't kill you unless you let them.<br><br>Nor will most competitors.  A lot of startups worry "what if Google builds something like us?"  Actually big companies are not the ones you have to worry about-- not even Google.  The people at Google are smart, but no smarter than you; they're not as motivated, because Google is not going to go out of business if this one product fails; and even at Google they have a lot of bureaucracy to slow them down.<br><br>What you should fear, as a startup, is not the established players, but other startups you don't know exist yet.  They're way more dangerous than Google because, like you, they're cornered animals.<br><br>Looking just at existing competitors can give you a false sense of security.  You should compete against what someone else <i>could</i> be doing, not just what you can see people doing.  A corollary is that you shouldn't relax just because you have no visible competitors yet.  No matter what your idea, there's someone else out there working on the same thing.<br><br>That's the downside of it being easier to start a startup: more people are doing it.  But I disagree with Caterina Fake when she says that makes this a bad time to start a startup.  More people are starting startups, but not as many more as could.  Most college graduates still think they have to get a job.  The average person can't ignore something that's been beaten into their head since they were three just because serving web pages recently got a lot cheaper.<br><br>And in any case, competitors are not the biggest threat.  Way more startups hose themselves than get crushed by competitors.  There are a lot of ways to do it, but the three main ones are internal disputes, inertia, and ignoring users.  Each is, by itself, enough to kill you.  But if I had to pick the worst, it would be ignoring users.  If you want a recipe for a startup that's going to die, here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know everyone is going to love, and that's what they're going to build, no matter what.<br><br>Almost everyone's initial plan is broken.  If companies stuck to their initial plans, Microsoft would be selling programming languages, and Apple would be selling printed circuit boards.  In both cases their customers told them what their business should be-- and they were smart enough to listen.<br><br>As Richard Feynman said, the imagination of nature is greater than the imagination of man.  You'll find more interesting things by looking at the world than you could ever produce just by thinking. This principle is very powerful.  It's why the best abstract painting still falls short of Leonardo, for example.  And it applies to startups too.  No idea for a product could ever be so clever as the ones you can discover by smashing a beam of prototypes into a beam of users.<br><br> <b>5. Commitment Is a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy.</b><br><br>I now have enough experience with startups to be able to say what the most important quality is in a startup founder, and it's not what you might think.  The most important quality in a startup founder is determination.  Not intelligence-- determination.<br><br>This is a little depressing.  I'd like to believe Viaweb succeeded because we were smart, not merely determined.  A lot of people in the startup world want to believe that.  Not just founders, but investors too.  They like the idea of inhabiting a world ruled by intelligence.  And you can tell they really believe this, because it affects their investment decisions.<br><br>Time after time VCs invest in startups founded by eminent professors. This may work in biotech, where a lot of startups simply commercialize existing research, but in software you want to invest in students, not professors.  Microsoft, Yahoo, and Google were all founded by people who dropped out of school to do it.  What students lack in experience they more than make up in dedication.<br><br>Of course, if you want to get rich, it's not enough merely to be determined.  You have to be smart too, right?  I'd like to think so, but I've had an experience that convinced me otherwise: I spent several years living in New York.<br><br>You can lose quite a lot in the brains department and it won't kill you.  But lose even a little bit in the commitment department, and that will kill you very rapidly.<br><br>Running a startup is like walking on your hands: it's possible, but it requires extraordinary effort.  If an ordinary employee were asked to do the things a startup founder has to, he'd be very indignant.  Imagine if you were hired at some big company, and in addition to writing software ten times faster than you'd ever had to before, they expected you to answer support calls, administer the servers, design the web site, cold-call customers, find the company office space, and go out and get everyone lunch.<br><br>And to do all this not in the calm, womb-like atmosphere of a big company, but against a backdrop of constant disasters.  That's the part that really demands determination.  In a startup, there's always some disaster happening.  So if you're the least bit inclined to find an excuse to quit, there's always one right there.<br><br>But if you lack commitment, chances are it will have been hurting you long before you actually quit.  Everyone who deals with startups knows how important commitment is, so if they sense you're ambivalent, they won't give you much attention.  If you lack commitment, you'll just find that for some mysterious reason good things happen to your competitors but not to you.  If you lack commitment, it will seem to you that you're unlucky.<br><br>Whereas if you're determined to stick around, people will pay attention to you, because odds are they'll have to deal with you later.  You're a local, not just a tourist, so everyone has to come to terms with you.<br><br>At Y Combinator we sometimes mistakenly fund teams who have the attitude that they're going to give this startup thing a shot for three months, and if something great happens, they'll stick with it-- "something great" meaning either that someone wants to buy them or invest millions of dollars in them.  But if this is your attitude, "something great" is very unlikely to happen to you, because both acquirers and investors judge you by your level of commitment.<br><br>If an acquirer thinks you're going to stick around no matter what, they'll be more likely to buy you, because if they don't and you stick around, you'll probably grow, your price will go up, and they'll be left wishing they'd bought you earlier.  Ditto for investors.  What really motivates investors, even big VCs, is not the hope of good returns, but the fear of missing out.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f6n"><font color="#777777">6</font></a>]</font> So if you make it clear you're going to succeed no matter what, and the only reason you need them is to make it happen a little faster, you're much more likely to get money.<br><br>You can't fake this.  The only way to convince everyone that you're ready to fight to the death is actually to be ready to.<br><br>You have to be the right kind of determined, though.  I carefully chose the word determined rather than stubborn, because stubbornness is a disastrous quality in a startup.  You have to be determined, but flexible, like a running back.  A successful running back doesn't just put his head down and try to run through people.  He improvises: if someone appears in front of him, he runs around them; if someone tries to grab him, he spins out of their grip; he'll even run in the wrong direction briefly if that will help.  The one thing he'll never do is stand still.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f7n"><font color="#777777">7</font></a>]</font><br><br> <b>6. There Is Always Room.</b><br><br>I was talking recently to a startup founder about whether it might be good to add a social component to their software.  He said he didn't think so, because the whole social thing was tapped out. Really?  So in a hundred years the only social networking sites will be the Facebook, MySpace, Flickr, and Del.icio.us?  Not likely.<br><br>There is always room for new stuff.  At every point in history, even the darkest bits of the dark ages, people were discovering things that made everyone say "why didn't anyone think of that before?"  We know this continued to be true up till 2004, when the Facebook was founded-- though strictly speaking someone else did think of that.<br><br>The reason we don't see the opportunities all around us is that we adjust to however things are, and assume that's how things have to be.  For example, it would seem crazy to most people to try to make a better search engine than Google.  Surely that field, at least, is tapped out.  Really?  In a hundred years-- or even twenty-- are people still going to search for information using something like the current Google?  Even Google probably doesn't think that.<br><br>In particular, I don't think there's any limit to the number of startups.  Sometimes you hear people saying "All these guys starting startups now are going to be disappointed. How many little startups are Google and Yahoo going to buy, after all?" That sounds cleverly skeptical, but I can prove it's mistaken.  No one proposes that there's some limit to the number of people who can be employed in an economy consisting of big, slow-moving companies with a couple thousand people each.  Why should there be any limit to the number who could be employed by small, fast-moving companies with ten each? It seems to me the only limit would be the number of people who want to work that hard.<br><br>The limit on the number of startups is not the number that can get acquired by Google and Yahoo-- though it seems even that should be unlimited, if the startups were actually worth buying-- but the amount of wealth that can be created.  And I don't think there's any limit on that, except cosmological ones.<br><br>So for all practical purposes, there is no limit to the number of startups.  Startups make wealth, which means they make things people want, and if there's a limit on the number of things people want, we are nowhere near it.  I still don't even have a flying car.<br><br> <b>7. Don't Get Your Hopes Up.</b><br><br>This is another one I've been repeating since long before Y Combinator. It was practically the corporate motto at Viaweb.<br><br>Startup founders are naturally optimistic.  They wouldn't do it otherwise.  But you should treat your optimism the way you'd treat the core of a nuclear reactor: as a source of power that's also very dangerous.  You have to build a shield around it, or it will fry you.<br><br>The shielding of a reactor is not uniform; the reactor would be useless if it were.  It's pierced in a few places to let pipes in. An optimism shield has to be pierced too.  I think the place to draw the line is between what you expect of yourself, and what you expect of other people.  It's ok to be optimistic about what you can do, but assume the worst about machines and other people.<br><br>This is particularly necessary in a startup, because you tend to be pushing the limits of whatever you're doing.  So things don't happen in the smooth, predictable way they do in the rest of the world.  Things change suddenly, and usually for the worse.<br><br>Shielding your optimism is nowhere more important than with deals. If your startup is doing a deal, just assume it's not going to happen.  The VCs who say they're going to invest in you aren't. The company that says they're going to buy you isn't.  The big customer who wants to use your system in their whole company won't. Then if things work out you can be pleasantly surprised.<br><br>The reason I warn startups not to get their hopes up is not to save them from being <i>disappointed</i> when things fall through.  It's for a more practical reason: to prevent them from leaning their company against something that's going to fall over, taking them with it.<br><br>For example, if someone says they want to invest in you, there's a natural tendency to stop looking for other investors.  That's why people proposing deals seem so positive: they <i>want</i> you to stop looking.  And you want to stop too, because doing deals is a pain.  Raising money, in particular, is a huge time sink.  So you have to consciously force yourself to keep looking.<br><br>Even if you ultimately do the first deal, it will be to your advantage to have kept looking, because you'll get better terms.  Deals are dynamic; unless you're negotiating with someone unusually honest, there's not a single point where you shake hands and the deal's done. There are usually a lot of subsidiary questions to be cleared up after the handshake, and if the other side senses weakness-- if they sense you need this deal-- they will be very tempted to screw you in the details.<br><br>VCs and corp dev guys are professional negotiators.  They're trained to take advantage of weakness.  <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f8n"><font color="#777777">8</font></a>]</font> So while they're often nice guys, they just can't help it.  And as pros they do this more than you.  So don't even try to bluff them.  The only way a startup can have any leverage in a deal is genuinely not to need it.  And if you don't believe in a deal, you'll be less likely to depend on it.<br><br>So I want to plant a hypnotic suggestion in your heads: when you hear someone say the words "we want to invest in you" or "we want to acquire you," I want the following phrase to appear automatically in your head: <i>don't get your hopes up.</i>  Just continue running your company as if this deal didn't exist.  Nothing is more likely to make it close.<br><br>The way to succeed in a startup is to focus on the goal of getting lots of users, and keep walking swiftly toward it while investors and acquirers scurry alongside trying to wave money in your face.<br><br> <b>Speed, not Money</b><br><br>The way I've described it, starting a startup sounds pretty stressful. It is.  When I talk to the founders of the companies we've funded, they all say the same thing: I knew it would be hard, but I didn't realize it would be this hard.<br><br>So why do it?  It would be worth enduring a lot of pain and stress to do something grand or heroic, but just to make money?  Is making money really that important?<br><br>No, not really.  It seems ridiculous to me when people take business too seriously.  I regard making money as a boring errand to be got out of the way as soon as possible.  There is nothing grand or heroic about starting a startup per se.<br><br>So why do I spend so much time thinking about startups?  I'll tell you why.  Economically, a startup is best seen not as a way to get rich, but as a way to work faster.  You have to make a living, and a startup is a way to get that done quickly, instead of letting it drag on through your whole life. <font color="#777777">[<a href="#f9n"><font color="#777777">9</font></a>]</font><br><br>We take it for granted most of the time, but human life is fairly miraculous.  It is also palpably short.  You're given this marvellous thing, and then poof, it's taken away.  You can see why people invent gods to explain it.  But even to people who don't believe in gods, life commands respect.  There are times in most of our lives when the days go by in a blur, and almost everyone has a sense, when this happens, of wasting something precious.  As Ben Franklin said, if you love life, don't waste time, because time is what life is made of.<br><br>So no, there's nothing particularly grand about making money.  That's not what makes startups worth the trouble.  What's important about startups is the speed.  By compressing the dull but necessary task of making a living into the smallest possible time, you show respect for life, and there is something grand about that.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] Startups can die from releasing something full of bugs, and not fixing them fast enough, but I don't know of any that died from releasing something stable but minimal very early, then promptly improving it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] I know this is why I haven't released Arc.  The moment I do, I'll have people nagging me for features.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] A web site is different from a book or movie or desktop application in this respect.  Users judge a site not as a single snapshot, but as an animation with multiple frames.  Of the two, I'd say the rate of improvement is more important to users than where you currently are.<br><br>[<a name="f4n"><font color="#000000">4</font></a>] It should not always tell this to users, however.  For example, MySpace is basically a replacement mall for mallrats.  But it was wiser for them, initially, to pretend that the site was about bands.<br><br>[<a name="f5n"><font color="#000000">5</font></a>] Similarly, don't make users register to try your site.  Maybe what you have is so valuable that visitors should gladly register to get at it.  But they've been trained to expect the opposite. Most of the things they've tried on the web have sucked-- and probably especially those that made them register.<br><br>[<a name="f6n"><font color="#000000">6</font></a>] VCs have rational reasons for behaving this way. They don't make their money (if they make money) off their median investments. In a typical fund, half the companies fail, most of the rest generate mediocre returns, and one or two "make the fund" by succeeding spectacularly.  So if they miss just a few of the most promising opportunities, it could hose the whole fund.<br><br>[<a name="f7n"><font color="#000000">7</font></a>] The attitude of a running back doesn't translate to soccer. Though it looks great when a forward dribbles past multiple defenders, a player who persists in trying such things will do worse in the long term than one who passes.<br><br>[<a name="f8n"><font color="#000000">8</font></a>] The reason Y Combinator never negotiates valuations is that we're not professional negotiators, and don't want to turn into them.<br><br>[<a name="f9n"><font color="#000000">9</font></a>] There are two ways to do  <a href="love.html">work you love</a>: (a) to make money, then work on what you love, or (b) to get a job where you get paid to work on stuff you love.  In practice the first phases of both consist mostly of unedifying schleps, and in (b) the second phase is less secure.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Trevor Blackwell, Beau Hartshorne, Jessica  Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading drafts of this.<br><br></xa></font>

Most dictionaries say hapless means unlucky.  But the dictionaries are not doing a very good job.  A team that outplays its opponents but loses because of a bad decision by the referee could be called unlucky, but not hapless.  Hapless implies passivity. To be hapless is to be battered by circumstances&mdash;to let the world have its way with you, instead of having your way with the world. <!--Unlucky is a bad synonym, because it emphasizes the role of chance in bad outcomes.  Hapless overlaps more with the other component of bad outcomes, the half that makes them deserved. --> <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f1n"><font color="#999999">1</font></a>]</font><br><br>Unfortunately there's no antonym of hapless, which makes it difficult to tell founders what to aim for.  "Don't be hapless" is not much of rallying cry.<br><br>It's not hard to express the quality we're looking for in metaphors. The best is probably a running back.  A good running back is not merely determined, but flexible as well.  They want to get downfield, but they adapt their plans on the fly.<br><br>Unfortunately this is just a metaphor, and not a useful one to most people outside the US.   "Be like a running back" is no better than "Don't be hapless."<br><br>But finally I've figured out how to express this quality directly. I was writing a talk for  <a href="angelinvesting.html">investors</a>, and I had to explain what to look for in founders.  What would someone who was the opposite of hapless be like?  They'd be relentlessly resourceful.  Not merely relentless.  That's not enough to make things go your way except in a few mostly uninteresting domains.  In any interesting domain, the difficulties will be novel.  Which means you can't simply plow through them, because you don't know initially how hard they are; you don't know whether you're about to plow through a block of foam or granite.  So you have to be resourceful. You have to keep trying new things.<br><br>Be relentlessly resourceful.<br><br>That sounds right, but is it simply a description of how to be successful in general?  I don't think so.  This isn't the recipe for success in writing or painting, for example.  In that kind of work the recipe is more to be actively curious. Resourceful implies the obstacles are external, which they generally are in startups. But in writing and painting they're mostly internal; the obstacle is your own obtuseness. <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f2n"><font color="#999999">2</font></a>]</font><br><br>There probably are other fields where "relentlessly resourceful" is the recipe for success.  But though other fields may share it, I think this is the best short description we'll find of what makes a good startup founder.  I doubt it could be made more precise.<br><br>Now that we know what we're looking for, that leads to other questions.  For example, can this quality be taught?  After four years of trying to teach it to people, I'd say that yes, surprisingly often it can.  Not to everyone, but to many people.  <font color="#999999">[<a href="#f3n"><font color="#999999">3</font></a>]</font> Some people are just constitutionally passive, but others have a latent ability to be relentlessly resourceful that only needs to be brought out.<br><br>This is particularly true of young people who have till now always been under the thumb of some kind of authority.  Being relentlessly resourceful is definitely not the recipe for success in big companies, or in most schools.  I don't even want to think what the recipe is in big companies, but it is certainly longer and messier, involving some combination of resourcefulness, obedience, and building alliances.<br><br>Identifying this quality also brings us closer to answering a question people often wonder about: how many startups there could be.  There is not, as some people seem to think, any economic upper bound on this number.  There's no reason to believe there is any limit on the amount of newly created wealth consumers can absorb, any more than there is a limit on the number of theorems that can be proven.  So probably the limiting factor on the number of startups is the pool of potential founders.  Some people would make good founders, and others wouldn't.  And now that we can say what makes a good founder, we know how to put an upper bound on the size of the pool.<br><br>This test is also useful to individuals.  If you want to know whether you're the right sort of person to start a startup, ask yourself whether you're relentlessly resourceful.  And if you want to know whether to recruit someone as a cofounder, ask if they are.<br><br>You can even use it tactically.  If I were running a startup, this would be the phrase I'd tape to the mirror.  "Make something people want" is the destination, but "Be relentlessly resourceful" is how you get there.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br> <b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n"><font color="#000000">1</font></a>] I think the reason the dictionaries are wrong is that the meaning of the word has shifted.  No one writing a dictionary from scratch today would say that hapless meant unlucky.  But a couple hundred years ago they might have.  People were more at the mercy of circumstances in the past, and as a result a lot of the words we use for good and bad outcomes have origins in words about luck.<br><br>When I was living in Italy, I was once trying to tell someone that I hadn't had much success in doing something, but I couldn't think of the Italian word for success.  I spent some time trying to describe the word I meant.  Finally she said "Ah! Fortuna!"<br><br>[<a name="f2n"><font color="#000000">2</font></a>] There are aspects of startups where the recipe is to be actively curious.  There can be times when what you're doing is almost pure discovery.  Unfortunately these times are a small proportion of the whole.  On the other hand, they are in research too.<br><br>[<a name="f3n"><font color="#000000">3</font></a>] I'd almost say to most people, but I realize (a) I have no idea what most people are like, and (b) I'm pathologically optimistic about people's ability to change.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Trevor Blackwell and Jessica Livingston for reading drafts of this.<br><br></p></font>
